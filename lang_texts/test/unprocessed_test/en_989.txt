	Mr President, I would like firstly to highlight the efforts made by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in order to be able to reach an agreement amongst all of the political groups, which is not at all easy given that the Commissionâ€™s initial proposal was aimed more towards the disappearance of sugar cultivation than its reform, without taking account of the resulting social cost.
