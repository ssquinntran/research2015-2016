chapter the family of da sh wood had long been settled in s us sex their estate was large and their residence wa sat nor land park in the centre of their property where for many generations they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance the late owner of this estate was a single man who lived to a very advanced age and who for many years of his life had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister bu the r death which happened ten years before his own produced a great alteration in his home for to supply her loss he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew mr henry da sh wood the legal in h eri to ro f then or land estate and the person to whom he intended to be quea t hit in the society of his nephew and niece and their children the old gentleman s days were comfortably spent his attachment to them all increased the constant attention of m ran d mrs henry da sh wood to his wishes which proceeded not merely from interest but from goodness of heart gave him every degree of so lid comfort which his age could receive and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence b ya former marriage mr henry da sh wood ha done son by his present lady three daughters the son a steady respectable young man was amply provided for by the fortune of his mother which had be enlarge and half of which de volv e don him on his coming of age by his own marriage likewise which happened soon afterwards he added to his wealth to him therefore the success i on to then or land estate was not so really important as to his sisters forth eir fortune independent of what might arise to them from their fathers inheriting that property could b ebu t small their mother had nothing and their father only seven thousand pounds in his ow ndi spo s al forth e remaining mo iety of his first wife s fortune was also secured to her child and he had only a life interest in it the old gentleman died his will was read and like almost every other will gave as much disappointment as pleasure h ewa s neither so unjust nor so ungrateful as to leave his estate from his nephew bu the left i tt o him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the be quest mr da sh wood had wished for it more forth e sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son but to his son and his sons son a child of four years old it was secured in such away as to leave to himself no power of pro vi d ing forth os e who were most dear to hi man d who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate or by any sale o fits valuable woods the whole was tied up forth e benefit of this child who in occasional visits with his father and mother at nor land had sofa r gained on the affections of his uncle by such attractions a sar e by no means unusual in children of two or three years old an im perfect art i cul a ti on an earnest desire of having his own way many cunn ing tricks and a great deal of noise as to outweigh all the value o fall the attention which for years he had received from his niece and her daughters he meant not to be unkind however and as a mark of his affection forth e three girls he left them a thousand pounds apiece mr da sh woods disappointment wa sat first severe bu this temper was cheerful and sanguine and he might reasonably hope t olive many years and by living eco n omi call y lay b ya considerable sum from the produce of an estate already large and capable of almost immediate improvement but the fortune which had been so tard y in coming was his only one twelvemonth he survive d his uncle no longer and ten thousand pounds including the late leg a cies was all that remained for his widow and daughters his son w assent for as soon as his danger was known and to h imm r da sh wood recommended wit hall the strength and urgency which illness could command the interest of his mother in law and sisters mr john da sh wood had not the strong feelings of there s to f the family but h ewa s affected b ya recommendation of such a nature at such a ti mean d he promised to do every thing in his power to make them comfortable his father was rendered easy by such an assurance and mr john da sh wood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudent lyb ei n his power to do forth em h ewa s no tan ill disposed young man unless to be rather cold hearted and ra t herself is his to be ill disposed but h ewa sin general well respected for he conduct ed himself with propriety in th edi s charge of his ordinary duties had he married a more amiable woman he might have been made still more respectable than h ewa she might even have been made amiable himself for h ewa s very young when he married and very fond of his wife but mrs john da sh wood was a strong car i ca tu r eo f himself more narrow minded and selfish when he gave his promise to his father he meditated within himself to increase the fortune s of his sisters by the present of a thousand pounds apiece he then really thought himself equal to it the prospect of four thousand a year in addition to his present income besides the remaining half of his own m others fortune warm ed his heart and made him feel capable of generosity ye she would give them three thousand pounds it would be liberal and handsome it would be e nought o make them completely easy three thousand pounds he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience he thought of i tall day long and for many days successively and h edi d not repent no sooner was his fathers funeral over than mrs john da sh wood without sending any notice of her intention to her mother in law arrived with her child and their attendant s no one could di s put e her right to come the house wa she r husbands from the moment of his fathers decease but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater and to a woman in mrs da sh woods situation with only common feelings must have been highly un pleasing but in her mind there was a sense of ho nor so keen a generosity so romantic that any offence of the kind by whom so ever given or received was to her a source of im move able disgust mrs john da sh wood had never been a favourite wi than yo f her husbands family but she had had no opportunity till the present of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion required its o acute ly did mrs da sh wood feel this ungracious behaviour and so earnestly did she despise her daughter in law for it that on the arrival of the latter she would have quitted the house forever had not the entreat yo f her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the propriety of going and hero wn tender love for all her three children determined her afterwards to stay and for theirs akes avoid ab reach with their brother e li north is eldest daughter whose advice was so effect u al possessed a strength of understanding and coolness of judgment which qualified her though only nineteen to b eth e counsellor of her mother and enabled her frequently to counteract to the advantage of them all that eagerness of mind in mrs da sh wood which must generally have l edt o imprudence she had an excellent h earth er disposition was affectionate and her feelings were strong but she knew how to g over n them it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught ma ri anne s abilities were in many respects quite equal to e li nor s shew as sensible and clever but eager in every thing her sorrow she r joy s could have no moderation shew as generous amiable interesting shew as every thing but prudent the resemblance between he ran d her mother was strikingly great e li nor saw with concern the excess of her sisters sensibility but by mrs da sh wood it was valued and ch eri she d they encouraged each other no win the violence of their affliction the agony of grief which overpowered them at first was voluntarily renewed was sought for was created again and again they gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford i tan d resolved against ever admit t ing consolation in future e li nor too was deeply afflicted but still she could struggles he could exert herself she could consult with her brother could receive her sister in law on her arrival and treat her with proper attention and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion and encourage her to similar forbearance ma rg are t the others is ter was a good hu more dwell disposed girl but as she had already imbi bed a good deal of ma ri anne s romance without having much of her senses h edi d not at thirteen bid fair to equal her sisters a ta more advanced period of life chapter mrs john da sh wood no wins tall ed herself mistress of nor land and her mother and sisters in law were de gr ad edt o the condition of visitors as such however they we retreated by her with quiet civility and by her husband with as much kindness a she could feel towards any body beyond himself his wife and their child he really pressed them with some earnestness to consider nor land as their ho mean da s no plan appeared so eligible tom rs da sh wood as remaining there till she could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood his invitation was accepted a continuance in a place where every thing reminded hero f former delight was exactly what suited her mind in season s of cheerfulness no temper could be more cheerful than hers or possess in a greater degree that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness itself but in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy and as far beyond consolation a sin pleasures h ewa s beyond alloy mrs john da sh wood did not a tall approve of what her husband intended to do for his sisters to take three thousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy would be imp over i shi ng him to them os t dreadful degree she begged him to think again on the subject how could he answer i tt o himself to rob his child and his only child too of so large a sum and what possible claim could them is s da sh woods who were related to him only by half blood which she considered as no relations hip a tall have on his generosity to so large an amount it was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist between the children of any man by different marriages and why wa she to ruin himself and their poor little harry by giving away all his money to his half sisters it was my fathers last request tom e replied her husband that i should assist his widow and daughters h edi d not know what h ewa s talking of i dares ay ten to one but h ewa slight headed at the time had he been in his rights en se she could not have thought of such a thing as begging y out o give away half your fortune from your own child h edi d not stipulate fo ran y particulars um my dear f an n yh e only requested m ei n general terms to assist them and make their situation more comfortable than i tw a sin his power to do perhaps it would have been a swell if he had left it wholly to myself he could hardly suppose i should neglect them but a she required the promise i could not do less than give i ta t least i thoughts oa t the time the promise therefore was given and must be perform ed something must be done forth em whenever they leave nor land and settle in an e whom e well then let something be done forth em but that something need not be three thousand pounds considers he added that when the money is once parted with it never can return your sisters will marry and it will be gone forever if indeed it could be restored to our poor little boy why to be sure said her husband very gravely that would make great difference the time may come when harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with if he should have a numerous family for instance it would b ea very convenient addition to be sure it would perhaps then it would be better for all parties if the sum were dim in i she done half five hundred pounds would be apro dig iou s increase to their fortune s oh beyond anything great what brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters even if really his sisters and a sit is only half blood bu tyo u have such a generous spirit i would not wish to do anything mean he replied one had rather on such occasions do too much than too little n oo neat least can think i have not done enough forth em even themselves they can hardly expect more there is no knowing what they may expect said the lady but wear e not to think of their expectations the question is what you can afford to do certainly and i think i may afford to give them five hundred pounds apiece a sit is without any addition of mine they will each ha v eabou t three thousand pounds on their m others death a very comfortable fortune fo ran y young woman to be sure i tis and indeed it strikes me that they can want no addition a tall they will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them if they marry they will be sure of doing well and if they do not they may all li v every comfortably together on the interest often thousand pounds that is very true and therefore i do not know whether upon the whole it would not be more advisable to do something forth eir mother while she lives rather than forth em something of the an nu i ty kind i mean my sisters would feel the good effects o fit a swell as herself a hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable his wife hesitated a little however in giving her consent to this plan to be sure s aids h ei tis better than parting with f if tee n hundred pounds at once but then if mrs da sh wood should live f if tee n years we shall be completely taken in f if tee n years my dear f an ny her life cannot be worth half that purchase certainly not but if you observe people always live forever when there is an an nu i ty to be paid them and she is very stout and healthy and hardly forty an an nu i ty is a very serious business it comes over and over every year and there is no getting rid o fit you are not aware of what you are doing i have known a great deal of the trouble of an nu i ties form y mother was clo g ge d with the pay men to f three too ld sup e ran nu a ted servants b ym y fathers will and i tis amazing how disagreeables he found it twice every y earth e sea n nu i ties were to be paid and then there was the trouble of getting i tt o them and the none of them was said to have died and afterwards it turned out to b en o such thing my mother was quite sick o fit her income was n other own she said with such perpetual claims on i tan di t was the more unkind in my father because otherwise the money would have been entirely at m ym others di spo s al without any re strict i on whatever it has given me such an abhor re nce of an nu i ties that ia m sure i would not pi n myself down to the pay men to f one for all the world i tis certainly an unpleasant thing replied mr da sh wood to have those kind of y early drain so none s income ones fortune as your mother justly says is no tones own to be tied down to the regular pay men to f such a sum on every r en t day is by no means desirable it takes away ones independence undoubtedly and after all you have no thanks for it they think themselves secure you don o more than what is expected and it raise s no gratitude a tall if i were you whatever i did should be done at my own discretion entirely i would not bi nd myself to allow them anything y early it may b every inconvenient some years to spare a hundred or even fifty pounds from ou row n expenses i believe you are right my love it will be better that there should by n oa n nu i ty in the case whatever i may give them occasionally will b eo f far greater assistance than ay early allowance because they would only enlarge theirs tyle of living if they felt sure of a larger income and would not be sixpence the rich er for i ta t the end of they ear it will certainly be much the best w aya present of fifty pounds now and then will prevent their ever being distressed for money and will i think be amply di sch a rg ing my promise tom y father to be sure it will indeed to say the truth ia m convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money a tall the assistance he thought of i dares ay was only such as might be reasonably expected of you for instances uch as looking out for a comfortable small house forth em helping them to move their things and sending them presents off i shan dga mean ds o forth whenever they are in season ill lay my life that he meant nothing farther indeed it would b every strange and unreasonable if h edi d do but consider my dear mr da sh wood how excessively comfortable your mother in law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls which brings them in fifty pounds a year apiece and of course they will pay their mother forth eir board out o fit altogether they will have five hundred a year amongst them and what on earth can four women want for more than that they will lives o cheap their housekeeping will be nothing a tall they will have no carriage no horses and hardly any servants they will keep no company and can have no expenses of any kind only conceive how comfortable they will be five hundred a year ia m sure i cannot imagine how they will spend half of i tan da s to your giving them more i tis quite absurd to think o fit they will be much more able to give you something upon my words aid mr da sh wood i believe you are perfectly right my father certainly could mean nothing more by his request tom e than what you say i clearly understand it now and i will strictly ful f ilm y engagement by such act s of assistance and kindness to them as you have described when my mother remove s into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as i can some little present of furniture t oom ay be acceptable then certainly returned mrs john da sh wood but however one thing must be considered when your father and mother moved to nor land thought he furniture of s tan hill was sold all the ch in ap late and linen was saved and i snow left to your mother her house will therefore be almost completely fitted u pass oo n as she takes it that is a material consideration undoubtedly a valuable l egacy indeed and yet some of the p late would have been a very pleasant addition too u row n stock her eyes and these to f breakfast ch in ai s twice as handsome as what belongs to this house a great dealt oo handsome in my opinion fo ran y place they ca never afford t olive in but however s oi tis your father thought only of them and i must say this that you owe no particular gratitude to him nor attention to his wishes for w every well know that if he could he would have left almost every thing in the world to them this argument was irresistible it gave to his intentions whatever of decision was wanting before and he final ly resolved that it would be absolutely unnecessary if not highly in d eco ro us to do more forth e widow and children of his father than such kind of neighbour ly act sash is own wife pointed out chapter mrs da sh wood remained at nor land several months not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while for when her spirits began to revive and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that of height en ing its affliction by melancholy remembrances shew as impatient to be gone and indefatigable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of nor land for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible but she could hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and ease and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter whose steadier judgment rejected several houses as too large forth eir income which her mother would have approved mrs da sh wood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour which gave comfort to his last earth ly reflections she doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he had doubted it himself and she thought o fit for her daughters sake with satisfaction though as for herself shew as persuaded that a much smaller provision than would support h eri n afflu e nce forth eir brothers sake too forth e sake of his own hearts he rejoiced and she reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before in believing him incapable of generosity his attentive behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfare was dear to hi man d for along times he firmly re lie don the liberality of his intentions th eco n tempt which she h adver y early in their acquaintance felt for her daughter in law was very much increased by the farther knowledge of her character which half a years residence in her family afforded and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal affection on the side of the former the two ladies might have found it impossible to have lived together so long had not a particular circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility according to the opinions of mrs da sh wood to her daughters continuance at nor land this circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and the brother of mrs john da sh wood a gentlemanlike and pleasing young man w how as introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sisters establishment at nor land and who had since spent the greatest part of his time there some m others might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of interest fore dw ard fer r ars was the eldest son of a man who had died very ri c handsome might have repressed it from motives of prudence for except a trifling sum the whole of his fortune depended on the will of his mother but mrs da sh wood was alike un influenced by either consideration it was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable that he loved her daughter and t hate li nor returned the partiality it was contrary to every d oct ri n eo f hers that difference of fortune should keep any couple asunder who were attract ed by resemblance of disposition and t hate li nor s merit should not be acknowledged by every o new ho knew her was to her comprehension impossible e dw ard fer r ars was not recommended to their good opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address h ewa s not handsome and his manners required intimacy to make them pleasing h ewa s too diffident to do justice to himself but when his natural shy ness was overcome his behaviour gave every i ndi ca ti on of an open affectionate h earth is understanding was good and his education had given its o lid improvement but h ewa s neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to answer the wishes of his mother and sister who longed to see him distinguished as they hardly knew what they wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some manner or other his mother wished to interest him in po li tic al concerns to get him into par lia men to r to see him connected with some of the great men of the day mrs john da sh wood wished it likewise but in the meanwhile till one of these superior blessings could be attained it would have quiet ed her ambition to see him driving a barouche bu ted w ard had no turn for great men or barouche s all his wishes c entered in domestic comfort and the quiet of private life fortunately he had a younger brother w how as more promising e

her manners were attaching and soon banished his reserves he speedily comprehended all his merits the persuasion of his regard fore li nor perhaps assisted her penetration but she really felt assured of his worth and event hat quietness of manner which m ili ta ted against all her established ideas of what a young man s address ought to b ewa s no longer un interesting when she knew his heart to

dejection of mind which frequently attended him a more reasonable cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the indulgence of his affections he knew th a this mother neither

with such a knowledge as this it was impossible fore li nor to feel easy on the subjects h ewa s far from depending on that result of his preference of her which her mother and sisters till considered ascertain nay the longer they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard and sometimes for a few painful minutes she believed i tt ob en o more than friendship but whatever might

her mother in law on the occasion talking to hers o expressive ly of her brothers great expectations of mrs fer r ars s resolution that both her sons should marry well and of the danger attending any

pressed her after giving the particulars of the house and g ardent o come with her daughters to bar to n park the place of his own residence from whence she might judge herself whether bar to n

sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to the place wa snow its first recommendation to quit the neighbourhood of nor land was no longer an evil it was an object of desire it was a blessing in comparison of the misery of continuing her daughter in law s guest and to remove forever from that beloved place would be less painful than to in habit or visit it while such a

and such constant visitors as to leave them little leisure for serious employment yet such was the case when ma ri anne was recovered the schemes of amusement a th o mean d abroad which sir john had been previously forming were put into execution the private balls at the park then began and parties on the water were made and accomplished a soften as a shower y october would allow in every meeting of the kind will ou gh by was included and the ease and familiar i ty which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the da sh

merely an unnecessary effort but a disgrace ful subjection of reason to commonplace and mistaken notions will ou gh by thought the sa mean d their behaviour a tall times was an ill us tr a ti on of their opinions when h ewa s presents he had no eyes fo ran y one else every thing h edi d was right every thing he said was clever if their evenings at the park were concluded with cards h ec heated himself and all there s to f the party together a good hand if dancing formed the amusement of the night they were partners for half the ti mean d when obliged to separate for a couple of dances were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word to any body else such conduct made them of course most exceedingly laughed at but ridicule could not shame and seemed hardly to provoke them mrs da

young and ardent mind this was the season of happiness tom a ri anne her heart was devoted to will ou gh by and the fond attachment to nor land which she brought with her from s us sex was more likely to be softened than she had thought it possible before by the charm s which his society bestowed on her present home e li nor s happiness was not so great her heart was not s om uc hate as e nor her

neither lady middle to n nor mrs j en n ing s could supply to her the conversations he missed although the latter was a never lasting talker and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensure d her a large share of her discourse she had already repeated hero wn history to e li nor three or four times and had e li nor s memory been equal to her means of improvement she might have known very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of mr j en n ing s last illness and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died lady middle to n was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent e li nor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve wa same re calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do towards her husband and m others h ewa s the s am east o them and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired she had nothing to say one day that she had not said the day before her insipid i ty was invariable for even her spirits were always the sa mean d though sh edi d not oppose the parties arranged by her husband provided every thing were conduct edi n style and her two eldest children attended hers he never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting a th o mean ds o little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others by any share in their conversation that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys in colonel b ran don alone o fall her new acquaintance did e li nor find a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities excite the interest of friendship or give pleasure as a companion will ou gh by was out of the question her admiration and regard even her sister ly regard was all his own but h ewa sa lover his attentions were wholly ma ri anne s and af a rles s agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing colonel b ran don unfortunately for himself had no such encouragement to think only of ma ri anne and in c on vers ing with e li nor he found the greatest consolation forth e indifference of her sister e li nor s compassion for him increased as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him this suspicion was given by some words which accident ly dropped from him one evening at the park when they were sitting down together by mutual consent while the others were dancing his eyes were fixed on ma ri anne and after a silence of some minutes he said with a faints mile your sister i understand does not approve of second attachments no replied e li nor her opinions a real l romantic or rather as i believes he considers them impossible to exist i believes he does but hows he contrive sit without reflecting on the character of hero wn father who had himself two wives i known ota few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation and then they may be more easy to de fine and to justify than they no ware by any body but herself this will probably b eth e case he replied and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions i cannot agree with youth er e said e li nor there are inconveniences attending such feelings as ma ri anne s which all the charm s of en thus ia s man d ignorance of the world cannot a tone for her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought and a better acquaintance with the world is what i look forward to a she r greatest possible advantage after a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment o ri sit equally crim in a li n every body are those who have been disappointed in their first choice whether from the inconstancy o fits object or the perverse ness of circumstances to be equally indifferent during there s to f their lives upon my word ia m not acquainted with them in utiae of her principles i only know that in every et heard her admit any instance of a second

frequently are they succeeded by such opinions a sar ebu t too common and too dangerous i speak from experience i once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resemble d your sister who thought and judged like her but who from an in forced change from a series of unfortunate circumstances here he stopt suddenly appeared to think that he had said too much and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures which might not otherwise have entered e li nor s head the lady would probably have passed without suspicion had he not convinced miss da sh wood that what concerned he rough t not to

and seven days are more than enough for others i should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother than from will ou ghb yo f john i know very little though we have lived together for years but of will ou ghb ym y judgment has long been formed e li nor thought it wisest to touch that point no more she knew her sisters temper opposition on so tender a subject would only attach her the more to hero wn opinion but b ya n appeal to her affection for her mother by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent mother must draw on herself if as would probably b eth e cases he consented to this increase of establishment ma ri anne was shortly subdued and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning the offer and to

to the concern and alarm which this sudden departure occasioned e li nor s uneasiness wa sat least equal to her m others she thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust will ou ghb ys

distress in which ma ri anne had quitted t hero om was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for though when she considered what ma ri anne s love for him was a quarrels e em ed almost impossible but whatever might b eth e particulars of their separation her sisters affliction was indubitable and she thought with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow which ma ri

be owned to us must have happened h edi d not speak h edi d not behave like himself you must have seen the difference a swell as i what can it be can they have quarrelled why else should he have shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here it was not inclination that he wanted e li nor i could plainly see that he had not the power of accepting i ti have thought it al lover i assure you and i can perfectly account forever y thing that at first seemed strange tom ea swell as to you can you indeed yes i have explained i tt o myself in them os t satisfactory way bu tyo ue li nor who love to doubt where you can it will not satisfy you i know bu tyo u shall not talk me out of my trust in i tia m persuaded that mrs smith suspect s his regard form a ri anne disapprove so fit perhaps because she has other views for hi man don that account is eager to get him away and that the business which she sends him off to t ran s act is invent e da s an excuse to di s miss him this is what i believe to have happened h ei s moreover aware that she does disapprove the connect i on he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with ma ri anne and he feels himself obliged from his dependent situation to give into her schemes and absent himself from de v on shi re for a while you will tell m ei know that this may or may not have happened but i will listen to no cavil unless you can point ou tan y other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this and now e li nor what have y out o say nothing for you have anticipated my answer then you would have told me that it might or might not have happened oh e li nor how incomprehensible are your feelings you had rather take evil upon credit than good you had rather look out for misery form a ri anne and guilt for poor will ou gh by than an apology forth e latter you are resolved to think him blameable because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn and is no allowance to be made for in adver ten c eo r for spirits depressed by recent disappointment are no probabilities to be accepted merely because they are not certain ties is nothing due to them an whom we have all such reason to love and no reason in the world to think ill of to the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves though un avoid ably secret for a while and after all what i sit you suspect him of i can hardly tell myself but suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him there is great truth however in what you have now urged of the allowances which ought to be made for hi man di tis my wish to be can did in my judgment of every body will ou gh by may undoubtedly ha v every sufficient reasons for his conduct and i will hope that he has but it would have been more like will ou gh by to acknowledge them at once secrecy may be advisable but still i cannot help wondering at its being practice d by him do not blame him however ford e parting from his character where the deviation is necessary bu tyo u really do admit the justice of what i have said in his defence ia m happy and h ei s acquitted not entirely it may be proper to conceal their engagement if they are engaged from mrs smith and if that is the case it must be highly expedient for will ou gh by to b ebu t little in de v on shi r eat present but this is no excuse forth eir concealing it from us concealing it from us my dear child do you accuse will ou gh by and ma ri anne of concealment this is strange indeed when your eyes have been reproaching them everyday for in cautiousness i want no proof of their affections aid e li nor but of their engagement i do ia m perfectly satisfied of both yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject by either of them i have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly has no this behaviour tom a ri anne and to all of us for at least the last fortnight declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation have we not perfectly understood each other has not my consent been daily asked by his looks his manner his attentive and affectionate respect m ye li nor i sit possible to doubt their engagement how could such a thought occur to you how i sit to be supposed that will ou gh by persuaded a she must b eo f your sisters love should leave he ran d leave her perhaps for months without telling hero f his affection that they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence i confess replied e li north at every circumstance except one i sin favour of their engagement but that one is the total silence of both on the subject and with m ei t almost outweigh s every other how strange this is you must think wretchedly indeed of will ou gh by if after all that has openly passed between them you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together ha she been acting apart in his behaviour to your sister all this timed o you suppose him really indifferent to h ern oi cannot think th a them u stand does love h eri am sure but with a strange kind of tenderness if he can leave her with such indifference such carelessness of the future as you attribute to him you must remember my dear mother that i have never considered this matter ascertain i have had my doubts i confess but they are faint er than they were and they may soon be entirely done away if we find they correspond every fear of mine will be removed a mighty concession indeed if you were to see them at the altar you would suppose they were going to be married ungracious girl but i require no such proof nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt no secrecy has been attempted all has been un i form ly open and unreserved you cannot doubt your sisters wishes it must be will ou gh by therefore whom you suspect but why i she not a man of honour and feeling has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm can he be deceit fuli h open o ti believe not cried e li nor i love will ou gh by sincerely love hi man d suspicion of his integrity cannot be more painful to yourself than tom ei t has been involuntary and i will not encourage it iwa s startled i confess by the alteration in his manners this morning h edi d not speak like himself and did not return your kindness wi than y cordiality bu tall this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed he had just parted from my sister had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction and if he felt obliged from a fear of offending mrs smith to resist the temptation of returning here soon and yet aware that by declining your invitation by saying that h ewa s going away for some time he should seem to ac tan ungenerous a suspicious part b your family be might well be embarrassed and disturbed in such a case a plain and open av o wa lo f his difficulties would have been more to his honour i think a swell as more consistent with his general character but i will not raise objections against any ones conduct on so illiberal a foundation as a difference in judgment from myself o ra deviation from what i may think right and consistent you speak very properly will ou gh by certainly does not deserve to be suspected though we have not known him long h ei s no stranger in this part of the world and who has ever spoken to his di s advantage had he been in a situation to act independent ly and marry immediately it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging every thing to meat once but this is not the case i tis an engagement in some respects not prosperous ly begun forth eir marriage must beat a very uncertain distance and even secrecy as far a sit can be

which though often impertinently expressed was perfectly of apiece with her general in qui sit i ve nessi n to the concerns of their family but sir john did not sport long with the curiosity which he

her attentions her as sid ui ties her flatteries at the park betrayed and she could have no lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined in sincerity with ignorance whose want of

mrs fer r ars e li nor did think the question a very od done and her countenance expressed i ta s she answered that she had never seen mrs fer r ars indeed replied lu cy i wonder at that for i thought

over the mantelpiece still hung a lands cape in coloured silk s of her performance in proof of her having spent seven years a ta great school in town to some effect as dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their arrival e li nor determined to employ the interval in writing to her mother and sat down forth at purpose in a few moments ma ri anne did the same ia m writing home ma

no more it immediately struck her that she must then be writing to will ou gh by and the conclusion which as instantly followed was that however mysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair they must be engaged this conviction though not entirely satisfactory gave her pleasure and she continued her letter with greater alacrity ma ri anne s was finished in a very few minutes in length it could

she opened the door advanced a few steps towards the stairs and after listening half a minute returned in t other oom in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard him would naturally produce in the ec s ta s yo f her feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming oh e li nor i tis will ou gh by indeed i tis and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms when

saw that it was not unnoticed by him that he even observed ma ri anne as she quitted t hero om with such astonishment and concern as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded towards herself is your sister ill said h ee li nor answered in some distress that shew as and then talked of headaches low spirits and over fatigues and of every thing to which she could decent ly attribute her sisters behaviour he heard her with them os t earnest attention but seeming to recollect himself said no more on the subject and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them in london making the usual inquiries about their journey and the friends they had left behind in this calm kind of way with very little interest o neither side they continued total k both of them out of spirits and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere e li nor wished very much to ask whether will ou gh by were then in town but shew as afraid of giving him pain by any en quiry after his rival and at length by way of saying something she asked if he had been in london ever since she had seen him last ye she replied with some embarrassment almost ever since i have been once or twice at de la ford for a

with the uneasiness and suspicions they had cause d tom rs j en n ing s and shew as fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt mrs j en n ing s

not long finished their breakfast before mr spa lm ers barouche stopped at the door and in a few minutes she came laughing into the rooms o delighted to see them all that it was hard to say whether she received most pleasure from meeting her mother or them is s da sh woods a gains o surprise da t their coming to town though it was what she had rather expected all along so angry at their

declining i ta t first was induced to go likewise wherever they went shew as evidently always on the watch in bond street especially where much of their business lay her eyes were in constant inquiry and in whatever shop the party were engaged her mind was equally a bs tr acted from every thing actually before them from all that interested and occupied the others restless and di s satisfied everywhere her sister could never o bta in her opinion of any article of purchase however it might equally concern them both she received no pleasure from anything was only impatient to beat home

the necessity of some serious en quiry into the affair mr spa l me ran d two elderly ladies of mrs j en n ing ss intimate acquaintance whom she had met and invited in the morning dined with them the

never learnt he game but though her time was therefore at hero w ndi spo salt he evening was by no means more productive of pleasure to her than to e li nor for it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation and the pain of disappointments he sometimes endeavoured for a few minutes to read but the book was soon thrown aside and she returned to the more interesting employment of walking backward s and forwards across t hero om pa using for a moment whenever she came to the window in hopes of distinguishing the long expected ra p chapter if this open weather holds much longer said mrs

when they do they seem to take its o much to heart that is true cried ma ri anne in a cheerful voice and walking to the window as she spoke to examine the day i had not thought of that this weather will keep many sports me ninth e country it was a lucky recollection all her good spirits were restored by i ti tis charming weather forth em indeed she continued as she sat down to the breakfast

yet while she saw ma ri anne in spirits she could not b every uncomfortable herself and ma ri anne wa sin spirits happy in the mildness of the weather and still happier in her expectation of a frost the morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the houses of mrs j en n ing ss acquaintance to in form them of her being in town and ma ri anne was all the time busy in observing the direction of the wind watching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the air don tyo u find it colder than i tw a sin the morning e li nor there seems tom ea very decided difference i can hardly keep my hands warm even in m ym uf fit was not so yesterday i think the clouds seem parting tooth e sun will be out in a moment and we shall have a clear afternoon e li nor was alter n ate ly diverted and pained but ma ri anne persevered and saw every night in the bright ness of the fire and every morning in the appearance of the atmosphere the certain symptoms of approaching frost them is s da sh woods had no greater reason to b edi s satisfied with mrs j en n ing ss style of living and set of acquaintance than with her behaviour to themselves which wa sin variably kind every thing in her house hold arrangements was conduct e don them os t liberal plan and excepting a few old ci ty friends whom to lady middle to ns regrets he had never dropped she visited no one to whom an introduction could a tall di s compose the feelings of her young companions pleased to find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had expected e li nor was very willing to compoun d forth e want of much real enjoyment from any of their evening parties which whether at home or abroad formed only for cards could have little to amuse her colonel b ran don who had a general invitation to the house was with them almost everyday he came to look at ma ri anne and talk to e li nor who often derived more satisfaction from c on vers ing with him than from any other daily occurrence but who saw at the same time with much concern his continued regard for her sisters he feared it was a strength en ing regard it grieved her to see the earnestness with which he often watched ma ri anne and his spirits were certainly worse than when at bar to n about a week after their arrival it became certain that will ou gh by was also arrived his card wa son the table when they came in from the mornings drive good god cried ma ri anne he has been here while we were out e li nor rejoiced to be assured of his being in london now ventured to say depend upon i the will call again to morrow but ma ri anne seemed hardly to hear he ran don mrs j en n ing s entrance escaped with the precious card this event while it raised the spirits o fel i nor restored to those of her sister al land more than all their former agitation from this moment her mind was never quiet the expectation of seeing him every hour of the day made her unfit for anything she insisted on being left behind the next morning when the others went out e li nor s thoughts were full of what might be passing in b er ke ley street during their absence but a moments glance a the r sister when they returned was e nought oi n form her that will ou gh by had paid no second visit there a note was just then brought in and laid on the table form e cried ma ri anne step p ing hastily forward n om aa m form y mistress but ma ri anne not

have no confidence in m em a ri anne n aye li north is reproach from you you who have confidence inn o one me returned e li nor in some confusion indeed ma ri anne i have nothing to tell nor i answered ma ri anne with energy our situations then are alike we have neither of us anything to tell you because you do not communicate and i because i conceal nothing e li nor distressed by this charge of reserve in herself which shew as not at liberty to do away knew not how under such circumstances to press for greater openness in ma ri anne mrs j en n ing s soon appeared and then o te being given hers here adi t aloud it was from lady middle to n announcing their arrival in c on du it street the night before and requesting the company of her mother and cousins the following evening business on sir john s part and a violent cold on hero wn prevented their calling in b er ke ley street the invitation was accepted but when the hour of ap point men t drew near necessary a sit wa sin common civility tom rs j en n ing s that they should both attend hero n such a visit e li nor had some difficulty in persuading her sister to go for still she had seen nothing of will ou gh by and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again in her absence e li nor found when the evening was over that disposition is not materially altered b ya change of abode for although scarcely settled in town sir john had contrived to collect around him nearly twenty young people and to amuse them with a ball this was an affair however of which lady middle to n did not approve in the country an un pre meditated dance was very allowable but in london where the reputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained it was risking too much forth e gratification of a few girls to have it known that lady middle to n had given a small dance of eight or nine couple with two vi o li ns and a mere sideboard collation m ran dm r spa lm er were of the party from the former whom they had not seen before since their arrival in town a shew as careful to avoid the appearance of any attention to his mother in law and therefore never came near her they received no mark of re cogni ti o non their entrance he looked at them slightly without seeming to know who they were and merely nodded tom rs j en n ing s from the others i de of t hero om ma ri anne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered it was enough h ewa s not there and she sat down equally ill disposed to receive or communicate pleasure after they had been assembled about an hour mr pa lm ers aunt e red towards them is s da sh woods to express his surprise on seeing them in town though colonel b ran don had been first informed of their arrival a this house and he had himself said something very dr ollo n hearing that they were to come i thought you were bo thin de v on shi re said h edi d you replied e li nor when do you go back again i do not know and thus ended their discourse never had ma ri anne been so unwilling to dance in her life as shew as that evening and never so much fatigued by the exercises he complained o fit as they returned to b er ke ley street aye aye said mrs j en n ing s we know the reason o fall that very well if a certain person who shall be name less had been there you would not have been a bit tired and to say the truth it was not very pretty of him not to give youth e meeting when h ewa s invited invited cried ma ri anne s om y daughter middle to n told me for it seems sir john met him somewhere in the street this morning ma ri anne said no more but looked exceedingly hurt impatient in this situation to be doing something that might lead to her sisters relief e li nor resolved to write the next morning to her mother and hoped by awake n ing her fears forth e health of ma ri anne to procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed and shew as still more eagerly bent on this measure by perceiving after breakfast on the morrow that ma ri anne was again writing to will ou gh by for she could not suppose i tt o be to any other person about the middle of the day mrs j en n ing s went out by herself on business and e li nor began her letter directly while ma ri anne too restless for employment too anxious for conversation walked from one window to the other or sat down by the fire in melancholy m edi ta ti one li nor was very earnest in her application to her mother relating all that had passed her suspicions of will ou ghb ys inconstancy urging her by every plea of duty and affection to demand from ma ri anne an account of her real situation with respect to him her letter was scarcely finished when a ra p foretold a visitor and colonel b ran don was announced ma ri anne who had seen him from the window and who hated company of any kind left t hero om before he entered i the looked more than usually grave and though expressing satisfaction at finding miss da sh wood alone as if he had somewhat in particular to tell hers at for some time without saying a word e li nor persuaded that he had some communication tom akei n which her sister was concerned im patiently expected its opening it was not the first time of her feeling the same kind of conviction for more than once before beginning with the observation of your sister looks unwell to day or your sisters e em s out of spirits he had appeared on the point either of di s closing o ro f inquiring something particular about her after a pause of several minutes their silence was broken by his asking h eri na voice of some agitation when h ewa s to congratulate hero n the acqui sit i on of a brother e li nor was not prepared for such a question and having no answer ready was obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient of asking what he meant he tried to smile a she replied your sisters engagement tom r will ou gh by is very generally known it cannot be generally known returned e li nor for hero wn family do not k no with e looked surprise d and said i beg your pardon ia m afraid my inquiry has been impertinent but i had not supposed any secrecy intended as they openly correspond and their marriage is universally talked of how can that be by whom can you have heard it mentioned by many by some of whom you know nothing by others with whom you are most intimate mrs j en n ing s mr spa l me ran d the middle to ns but still i might not have believed it for where them i ndi s perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced it will always find something to support its doubts if i had not when the servant let me into day accidentally seen a letter in hi shan d directed tom r will ou gh by in your sisters writing i came to inquire but iwa s convinced before i could ask the question is every

to do an don your prudence i have the strongest dependence tell me that i tis all absolutely resolved on that any attempt that in short concealment if concealment be possible is all that remains these words which conveyed to e li nor a direct av o wa lo f his love for her sister affected her very much shew as not immediately able to say anything and even when her spirits were recovered she debate d for a short time on the answer it would be most proper to give there al state of things between will ou gh by and her sister was so little known to herself that in endeavouring to explain its he might b ea s liable to say too much as too little yet as shew as convinced that ma ri anne s affection for will ou gh by could leave no hope of colonel b ran don s success whatever the event of that affection might be and at the same time wished to shi el d her conduct from censure she thought it most prudent and kind after some consideration to say more than she really knew or believed she acknowledged therefore that though she had never been informed by themselves of the terms on which they stood with each other of their mutual affections he had no doubt and of their correspondence shew as not astonished to hear he listened to her with silent attention an don her ceasing to speak rose directly from his seat and after saying in a voice of emotion to your sister iwi shall i ma g in able happiness to will ou gh by th a them ay endeavour to deserve her took leave and went away e li nor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points shew as left on the contrary with a melancholy impression of colonel b ran don s unhappiness and was prevented even from wishing it removed by her anxiety forth every event that must confirm it chapter nothing occurred during the next three or four days to make e li nor regret what she had done in applying to her mother for will ou gh by neither came nor wrote they were engaged about the end of that time to attend lady middle to n to a party from which mrs j en n ing s was kept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter and forth is party ma ri anne wholly di

standing within a few yards of them in earnest conversation with a very fashionable looking young woman she soon caught his eye and he immediately bowed but without at tempting to speak to hero r to

h ei s there h ei s there oh why does he not look at me why cannot i speak to him pray pray be composed cried e li nor and do not betray what you feel to every body present perhaps he has not observed

which affected every feature at last he turned round again and regarded them both she started up and pro n ou nc ing his name in a tone of affection held out her hand to him he approached and addressing himself rather to e li north an ma ri anne as if wishing to avoid here ye and determined not to observe her attitude inquired in a hurried manner after mrs da sh wood and asked how long they had been in town e li nor was robbed o fall presence of mind by such an address and was unable to s aya word but the feelings of her sister were instantly expressed her face was crim s one d over

catching the eye of the young lady with whom he had been previously talking he felt the necessity of instant exertion he recovered himself again and after saying yes i had the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town which you were so good as to send me turned hastily away with a slight bow and joined his friend ma ri anne now looking dreadfully white and unable to stands un

could she prevent her from following him herself and to persuade her to check her agitation to wait at least with the appearance of composure till she might speak to him with more pri v acy and more

hero om by the door towards the staircase and telling ma ri anne that h ewa s gone urged the impossibility of speaking to him again that evening as a fresh argument for her to be calm she instantly begged her sister would entreat lady middle to n to take them home as shew as too miserable to stay a minute longer lady middle to n though in the middle of a rubber on being informed that ma ri anne was unwell was too polite to object for a moment to her wish of going away and making over her cards to a friend they departed as soon the carriage could be found scarcely a word was spo k enduring

like i would send al lover the town for it well i tis the oddest thing tom e that a man should use such a pretty girls o ill but when there is plenty of money o none s idea nd next to none on the

they say but not handsome i remember her aunt very well bid dy h en sh awes he married a very wealth y man but the family a real l rich together fifty thousand pounds and by all accounts i two nt come before its wanted forth ey say h ei s all to pieces no wonder dashing about with his curricle and hunt er swell it don t signify talking but when a young man be who he will comes and makes love to a pretty girl and promises marriage he has no business to fly off from his word only because he grows poor and a rich er girl is ready to have him why don the in such a cases el l his horses le this house turn off his servants and make a thorough re form at once i warrant you miss ma ri anne would have been ready to wait till matters came round but that wo nt do now a days nothing in th ewa yo f pleasure ca never be given up by the young men of this age do you know what kind of a girl miss grey is is she said to be amiable i never heard any harm of her indeed i hardly ever heard her mentioned except that mrs taylor did say this morning that one day miss walker hint edt o her that she believed m ran dm r sell i son would not be sorry to have miss grey married for she and mr sell i son could never agree and who are the el li sons her guard ia ns my dear but now she i sofa ge and may choose for herself and a pretty choice she has made what now after pa using a moment your poor sister is gone to hero wn room i suppose tom oa n by herself is there nothing one can get to comfort her poor dear it seems quite cruel to let her be alone well by and by we shall have a few friends and that will amuse her a little what shall we play at she hate s whist i know but is there no round games he cares for dear ma am this kindness is quite unnecessary ma ri anne i dares ay will not leave her room again this evening i shall persuade h eri fi can to go early to bed for ia m sure she wants rest aye i believe that will be best for he rle the r name hero wn supper and got o bed lord no wonders he has been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two forth is matter i suppose has been hanging over her head as long as that and so the letter that came to day finished it poor soul ia m sure if i had had a notion o fit i would not have joke d her about it for all my money but then you know how should i guess such a thing i made sure o fits being nothing but a common love letter and you know young people like to be laughed at about them lord how concerned sir john and my daughters will be when they hear i ti fi had my senses about m ei might have called in c on du it street in my

ever be said to myself on the subject the more my feelings will be spared as you my dear madam will easily believe oh lord yes that i do indeed it must be ter r ible for y out o hear it talked of and as for your sister ia m sure i would not mention a word about i tt o her forth e world you saw i did no tall dinner time no more would sir john nor my daughters forth e ya real l very thoughtful and

do you know in this affair it can only do harm more so perhaps than in many cases of a similar kind for it has been attended by circumstances which forth e sake of every one concerned in it m akei t unfit to become the public conversation i must do this justice tom r will ou gh by he has broken no positive engagement with my sister law my dear don t pretend to defend him no positive engagement indeed after taking her al lover all en ha m house and fixing on th every rooms they were t olive in hereafter e li nor for her sisters sake could not press the subject farther and she hoped it was not required of her for will ou ghb ys since though ma ri anne might lose much he could gain very little by the en force men to f there al truth after a short silence on both side s mrs j en n ing s

were nearly the sa mean d from our earliest years we were play fellows and friends i cannot remember the time when i did not love e li za and my affection for her as we grew up was such as perhaps judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity you might think me incapable of having ever felt hers form ewa si believe fer vent as the attachment of your sister tom r will ou gh by and it was

too far and the blow was a severe one but had her marriage been happy so young as i then wa safe w months must have reconciled met oi to ra t least i should not have now to lament it this however was not the case my brother had no regard for her his pleasures were not what they ought to have been and from the first he treated he run kindly the consequence of this upon a minds o young so lively so inexperience da s mrs b ran don s was but too natural she resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation and happy h adi t been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the

sometimes see their brother ma ri anne had promised to be guided by her m others opinion and she submitted to it therefore without opposition though it proved perfectly different from what she wished and expected though she felt i tt o be entirely wrong formed on mistaken grounds and that by requiring her longer continuance in london it deprived hero f the only possible alleviation of her wretchedness the personal sympathy of her mother and doomed her to such society and such scenes as must prevent her ever knowing a moments rest but it was a matter of great consolation to her that what brought evil to herself would bring good to her sister and e li nor on the other hand suspecting that it would not b ei n her power to avoided w ard entirely comforted herself by thinking that

to us to hear i ti assure you e li nor did feel a little ashamed of her brother and was not sorry to be spared the necessity of answering him by the arrival of mrs j en n ing ss servant who came to

walk with him t oco nd u it street and introduce him to sir john and lady middle to n the weather was remarkably fine and she readily consented as soon as they were out of the house his e nquiries began who is colonel b ran don i she a man of fortune ye she has very good property in do r sets h ir e ia m glad o fit he seems a most gentlemanlike man and i think e li nor i may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life me brother what do you mean he likes you i observed him narrow ly and am convinced o fit what is the amount of his fortune i believe about two thousand a year two thousand a year and then working himself up to a pitch of en thus ia s tic generosity he added e li nor i wish wit hall my heart it were twice as much for yours ake indeed i believe you replied e li nor but ia m very sure that colonel b ran don has not the smallest wish of marrying me you are mistaken e li nor you ar every much mistaken a very little trouble on yours i de secures him perhaps just at present he may be undecided the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back his friends may all advise him against it but some of those little attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix him in spite of himself and there can b en o reason why you should not try for him i tis not to be supposed that any pri or attachment on yours i de in short you know as to an attachment of that kind i tis quite out of the question the objections are in sur m ou n table you have too much sense not to see all that colonel b ran don must be them an and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with you and your family i tis a match that must give universal satisfaction in short i tis a kind of thing that lowering his voice to an important whisper will be exceedingly welcome to all parties recollecting himself however he added that is i meant o say your friends a real l truly anxious to see you well settled f an ny particularly for she has your interest very much at heart i assure you and her mother t oom rs fer r ars a very goodnatured woman ia m sure it would give her great pleasures he said as much the other d aye li nor would not vouchsafe any answer it would be something remarkable now he continued something d roll if f an ny should have a brother and ia sister settling at the same ti mean d yet i tis not very unlikely is m red w ard fer r ars said e li nor with resolution going to be married i tis not actually settled but there is such a thing in agitation he has a most excellent mother mrs fer r ars with the utmost liberality will come forward and settle on him a thousand a year if the match takes place the lady is the h on miss m or to n only daughter of the late lord m or to n with thirty thousand pounds a very desirable connect io non both side s and i have not a doubt o fits taking place in time a thousand a year is a great deal for a mother to give away to make over forever but mrs fer r ars has a noble spirit to give you another instance of her liberality the other d aya s soon as we came to town aware that money could not b every plenty with us just now she put bank notes into f an n ys hands to the amount of two hundred pounds and extremely acceptable i tis for we must live a ta great expense while wear e here he paused for her assent and compassion and she forced herself to say your expenses bo thin town and country must certainly be considerable but your income is a large one not so large i dares aya s many people suppose i do not meant o complain however i tis undoubtedly a comfortable one and i hope will in time be better the en clo sure of nor land common now carrying on is a most serious drain and then i have made a little purchase within this half year east king ha m farm you must remember the place where old g ib son used t olive the land was so very desirable form ei n every respects o immediately adjoining my own property that i felt it my duty to buy i ti could not have answered it tom y conscience to let it fall into any other hands a man must pay for his convenience and it has cost m ea vast deal of money more than you think it really an dint ri ns i call y worth why ih open ot that i might have sold it again the next day for more than i gave but with regard to the purchase money i might have been very unfortunate indeed forth e stock s were at that times o low that if i had not happened to have the necessary sum in my bank ers hands i must have sold out to very great loss e li nor could only smile other great and inevitable expenses too we have ha don first coming to nor land our respected father as you well know be quea the d all the s tan hill effects that remained at nor land and very valuable they were to your mother far b ei t from met or ep in ea this doings oh e had an undoubted right to dispose of his own property a she chose but in consequence o fit we have been obliged to make large purchase s of linen ch in act o supply the place of what was taken away you may guess after all these expenses how very far we must be from being rich and how acceptable mrs fer r ars s kindness is certainly said e li nor and assisted by her liberality i hope you may yet live to b ei n easy circumstances another year or two may do much towards i the gravely replied but however there is still a great dealt o be done there is not a stone laid off an n ys green house and nothing but the plan of the flower garden marked out where is the green house to be upon the kn ol l behind the house the old wa l nut trees a real l come down to make room for i ti t will b ea very fine object from many parts of the park and the flower garden will slope down just before i tan d be exceedingly pretty we have cleared away all the old th o rn s that grew in patch es over the b row e li nor kept her concern and her censure to herself and was very thankful that ma ri anne was not present to share the provocation having now said e nought o make his poverty clear and to do away the necessity of buy ing a pair o fear ring s fo reach of his sisters in his next visit at gr ays his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn and he began to congratulate e li nor on having such a friend as mrs j en n ing s she seems a most valuable woman indeed her house her style of living all be speak an exceeding good income and i tis an acquaintance that has not only been of great u set o you hitherto but in the end may prove materially advantageous her inviting y out o town is certainly a vast thing in your favour and indeed it speaks altogether so great a regard for youth a ti n all probability when she dies you will not be forgotten she must have a great dealt o leave nothing a tall i should rather suppose for she has only her joint u re which will de sc end to her children but i tis not to be imagined that she lives up to her income few people of common prudence will do that and whatever she saves she will be able to dispose of and do you not think it more likely that she should leave i tt o her daughters than to usher daughters are both exceedingly well married and therefore i cannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther where a sin my opinion by her taking so much notice of you and tr eating you in th i skin do f ways he has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration which ac on s cie nt iou s woman would not di s regard nothing can be kinder than her behaviour and she can hardly do all this without being aware of the expectation it raise s but she raise s none in those most concerned indeed brother your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries y out oo far why to be sure said he seeming to recollect himself people have little ha v every little in their power but my dear e li nor what is the matter with ma ri anne she looks very unwell has lost her colour and is grown quite thin is she ill she is not well she has had a nervous complaint on her for several weeks ia m sorry forth a ta the r time of life anything of an illness destroy s the bloom forever hers has been a very short ones h ewa s as handsome a girl last september as ie vers a wan da s likely to attract them an there was something in her style of beauty to please them particularly i remember f an ny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did not but what she is exceedingly fond of you but s oi t happened to strike hers he will be mistaken however i question whether ma ri anne now will marry a man worth more than five or six hundred a year at the utmost and ia m very much deceived if you do not do better do r sets h ir ei know very little of do r sets h ir ebu t my dear e li nor i shall be exceedingly glad to know more of i tan di think i can answer for your having f an ny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors e li nor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no likelihood of her marrying colonel b ran don but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished and h ewa s really resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman and promoting the marriage by every possible attention he had just compunction enough for having done nothing for his sisters himself to be exceedingly anxious that every body else should do a great deal and an offer from colonel b ran do nor al egacy from mrs j en n ing s was the ea s ies t means o fat on ing for his own neglect they were lucky e nought o find lady middle to na th o mean d sir john came in before their visit ended abundance of civilities passed on all sid essi r john was ready to like any body and though mr da sh wood did not seem to know much about horses he soon set him down as a very goodnatured fellow while lady middle to n saw enough of fashion in his appearance to think his acquaintance worth having and mr da sh wood went away delighted with both i shall have a charming account to carry to f an ny said h ea she walked back with his sister lady middle to n is really a most elegant woman such a woman as ia m sure f an ny will be glad to know and mrs j en n ing s too an exceedingly well behaved woman though not so elegant a she r daughter your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting her which to say the truth has been a little the case and very naturally for we only knew that mrs j en n ing s was the widow of a man who had go tall his money in a low w aya n dfa n ny and mrs fer r ars were both strongly pre possessed that neither she nor her daughters were such kind of women as f an ny would like to associate with but now i can carry her a most satisfactory account of both chapter mrs john da sh wood had so much confidence in her husbands judgment that she waited th every next day both on mrs j en n ing s and her daughter and her confidence was rewarded by finding event he former event he woman with whom her sisters were staying by no means unworthy her notice and as for lady middle to n she found hero n eo f them os t charming women in the world lady middle to n was equally pleased with mrs da sh wood there was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both side s which mutually attract ed them and they sympathise d with each other in an insipid propriety of de mean o ran da general want of understanding the same manners however which recommended mrs john da sh wood to the good opinion of lady middle to n did not suit the fancy of mrs j en n ing s and to hers he appeared nothing more than a little proud looking woman of un cordial address whom eth er husbands sisters without any affection and almost without having anything to say to them for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on b er ke ley streets he sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence e li nor wanted very much to know though sh edi d notch u set o ask whether e dw ard was then in town but nothing would have induced f an ny voluntarily to mention his name before her till able to tell her th a this marriage with miss m or to n was resolved o nor till her husbands expectations on colonel b ran don were answered because she believed them still so very much attached to each other that they could not be too se dulou sly divided in word and deed on every occasion the intelligence however which she would not gives oo n flowed from another quarter l uc yc am every shortly to claim e li nor s compassion on being unable to see e dw ard though he had arrived in town with m ran d mrs da sh wood he dared not come to bar t let ts building s for fear of de te c ti on and thought heir mutual impatience to meet was not to be told they could do nothing at present but write e dw ard assured them himself of his being in town within a very short time by twice calling in b er ke ley street twice was his card found on the table when they returned from their mornings engagements e li nor was pleased that he had called and still more pleased that she had missed him the da sh woods were so pro dig iou sly delighted with the middle to ns that though not much in the habit of giving anything they determined to give them a dinner and soon after their acquaintance began invited them to dine in ha rle y street where they had taken a very good house forth re e months their sisters and mrs j en n ing s were invited likewise and john da sh wood was careful to secure colonel b ran don who always glad to be where them is s da sh woods were received his eager civilities with some surprise but much more pleasure they were to meet mrs fer r ars but e li nor could not learn whether her sons were to b eo f the party the expectation of seeing her however was e nought o make her interested in the engagement for though she could now meet e dw ard s mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised to attends uch an introduction though she could now see her with perfect indifference as to her opinion of herself her desire of being in company with mrs fer r ars her curiosity to know what shew as like was as lively as ever the interest with which she thus anticipated the party was soon afterwards increased more powerful ly than pleasantly by her hearing that them is ss tee les were also to beat its o well had they recommended themselves to lady middle to ns o agreeable had their as sid ui ties made them to her that though lu cy was certainly not so elegant and her sister note v en genteel shew as as ready as sir john to ask them to spend a week or two in c on du it street and it happened to be particularly convenient to them is ss tee les as soon as the da sh woods invitation was known that their visit should begin a few days before the party took place their claims to the notice of mrs john da sh wood as the nieces of the gentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother might not have done much however towards procuring them seats a the r table but as lady middle to ns guests they must be welcome and lu cy who had long wanted to be personally known to the family to have a nearer view of their characters and hero wn difficulties and to have an opportunity of endeavouring to please them had seldom been happier in her life than shew a son receiving mrs john da sh woods card one li nor its effect was very different she began immediately to determine t hated w ard who lived with his mother must be asked as his mother was to a party given by his sister and to see him forth e first time after all that passed in the company of lu cy she hardly knew hows he could bear it these apprehension s perhaps were not found ed entirely on reason and certainly not a tall on truth they were relieved however not by hero wn recollection but by the goodwill of lu cy who believed herself to be inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her t hated w ard certainly would not b ei n ha rle y street on tuesday and even hoped to be carrying the pain still farther by persuading her that h ewa s kept away by the extreme affection for herself which he could not conceal when they were together the important tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladies to this formidable mother in law pity me dear miss da sh woods aid l uc ya s they walked up the stairs together forth e

in a moment i shall see the person th a tall my happiness depends on that is to b em y mother e li nor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the possibility o fits being miss m or to ns

disgrace of insipid i ty by giving it the strong characters of pride and ill nature shew as not a woman of many words for unlike people in general she proportion ed them to the number of her ideas and of the few syllables that did escape h ern o tone fell to the share of miss da sh wood whom she eye d with the spirited determination of di s liking her a tall events e li nor could not now be made unhappy by this behaviour a few months ago it would have hurt her exceedingly but it was not in mrs fer r ars power to distress her by it now and the difference of her manners to them is ss tee les a difference which seemed purposely made to humble her more only amused hers he could not but smile to see the graciousness of both mother and daughter towards th every person for lu cy was particularly distinguished whom o fall others had they known as much as sh edi d they would have been most anxious to mortify while she herself who had comparatively no power to wound t hems at pointedly slighted

that in dig e nce which he had tried to in fer from it no poverty of any kind except of conversation appeared but there the deficiency was considerable john da sh wood had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing and his wife had still less but there was no peculiar disgrace in this for it was very much the case with the chief of their visitors who almost all labour ed under one or other of these di s qu a li fi ca ti on s for being agreeable want of sense either natural or improved want of elegance want of spirits or want of temper when the ladies with drew to the drawing room after dinner this poverty was particularly evident forth e gentlemen had supplied the discourse with some variety the variety of politics in closing land and breaking horses but then it was al lover an done

children been there the affair might have been determined too easily by measuring them at once but as harry only was present it was all c on j ec t ura l assertion on both side s and every body had aright to be equally positive in their opinion and to repeat it over and over again a soften as they liked the parties stood thus the two m others though each really convinced that hero wn son was the

and miss s tee le with yet greater address gave i ta s fast as she could in favour of each e li nor having once delivered her opinion on william s side by which she offended mrs fer r ars an dfa n ny still more did not see the necessity of en forcing it by any farther assertion and ma ri anne when called on for hers offended them all by declaring that she had no opinion to give as she had never thought about it before her removing from nor land e li nor had pain ted a very pretty pair of screen s for her sister in law which being now just mounted and brought home ornamented her present

a little she immediately said they ar every pretty ma a man t they but then again the dread of having been too civil too encouraging herself probably came over her for she presently added do you not think they are something in miss m or to ns style of pain t ing ma am she does pain t most delightfully how beautifully her last lands cape is done beautifully indeed but she does every thing well ma ri anne could not b earth is shew as already greatly displeased with mrs fer r ars and such ill timed praise of another ate li nor s expense though she had no tan y notion of what was principally meant by it provoked her immediately to say with warmth this is admiration of a very particular kind what is miss m or to n to us who knows or who cares for h eri tis e li nor of whom we think and

she moved after a moment to her sisters chair and putting o near m round her neck an done cheek closet o hers said in a low but eager voice dear dear e li nor don t mind them don t let them make you unhappy she could say no more her spirits were quite overcome and hid ing her face one li nor s shoulders he burst into tears every body s attention was called and almost every body was concerned colonel b ran don rose up and went to them without knowing what h edi d mrs j en n ing s with a very intelligent ah poor dear immediately gave her hers al ts and sir john felt so desperately en r age

himself but ma ri anne who saw his agitation and could easily trace i tt o whatever cause best pleased herself was perfectly satisfied and soon talked of something else we spent such ad aye dw ard in ha rle y street yesterday so dull so wretchedly dull but i have much to say to you on that head which cannot be said now and with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her finding their mutual relative s more disagreeable th a never and of her being particularly disgusted with his mother till they were more in private but why were you not there e dw ard why did you not come iwa

if they have no mind to keep them little a swell as great e li nor was very angry but ma ri anne seemed entirely insensible of the sting for she calmly replied not so indeed for seriously speaking ia

i tis so and i will say it what are you never to hear yourself praised then you must b en o friend of mine forth os e who will accept of my love and esteem must submit tom y open commendation the

his encouragement failed for he would go and lu cy who would have out staid him had his visit lasted two hours soon afterwards went away what can bring her here so often said ma ri anne on her leaving them could not she see that we wanted her gone how tea z ing to e dw ard why s owe were all his friends and lu cy has been the longest known to him of any i tis but natural that he should like to see her a swell as ourselves ma ri anne looked a the r steadily and said you know e li north at this is a kind of talking which i cannot bear if you only hope to have your assertion contradicted as i must

was as little valued a sit was professedly sought they had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former and by the latter they were considered with a jealous eye a sin tru d ing on their ground and sharing the kindness which they wanted tom on op ol ize though nothing could be more polite than lady middle to ns behaviour to e li nor and ma ri anne sh edi d not really like them a tall because they neither flattered herself nor her children she could not believe them goodnatured and because they were fond of reading she fancied t hems at iri ca l perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to be sat iri ca l but that did not signify it was censure in common u sea nd easily given their presence was a restraint both on he ran don lu cy it checked the idleness of one and the business of the other lady middle to n was ashamed of doing nothing before them and the flattery which lu cy was proud to think of and administer at other times she feared they would despise her for offering miss s tee l ewa s the least discomposed of the three by their presence and i tw a sin their power to reconcile her to it entirely would either of them only have given her a full and minute account of the whole affair between ma ri anne and mr will ou gh by she would have thought herself amply rewarded forth e sacrifice of the best place by the fire after dinner which their arrival occasioned but this c on ci lia ti on was not granted for though she often threw out expressions of pity for her sister to e li nor and more than once dropt a reflection on the inconstancy of beau x before ma ri anne no effect was produced but a look of indifference from the former o ro f disgust in the latter an effort even yet lighter might have made her their friend would they only have laughed a the r about the d oct or but so little were they any more than the others inclined to oblige her that if sir john dined from homes he might spend a whole day without hearing any other rai l ler yo n the subject than what shew a skin de nought o bestow on herself all these jealous ies and discontent s however were so totally unsuspected by mrs j en n ing s that she thought i ta delightful thing forth e girls to be together and generally congratulated her young friends every night on having escaped the company of a stupid old woman so long she joined them sometimes at sir john s sometimes at hero wn house but wherever it was she always came in excellent spirits full of delight and importance attributing ch ar lot te swell doing to hero wn care an dread y to gives o exact so

both side s there was no convincing his father o fit no persuading him to believe that it was not exactly like every other baby of the same age nor could he even be brought to acknowledge the simple proposition o fits being the finest child in the world i come now to the relation of a misfortune which about this time be fell mrs john da sh wood its o happened that while her two sisters with mrs j

other people will carry them away to form wrong judgment so four conduct and to decide on it by slight appearances ones happiness must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance in the present instance this last arrived lady allowed her fancy to sofa rout run truth and probability that on merely hearing then am eo f them is s da sh woods and understanding them to b em r da sh woods sisters she immediately concluded them to be staying in ha rle y street and this mis construction produced within a day or two afterwards cards of invitation forth em a swell as forth eir brother and sister to a small musical party a the r house the consequence of which was that mrs john da sh wood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly great inconvenience of sending her carriage forth e miss da sh woods but what was still worse must be subject to all th eun pleasantness of appearing to treat them with attention and who could tell that they might not expect to go out with her a second time the power of disappointing them it was true must always be hers but that was not enough for when people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong they feel injured by the expectation of anything better from them ma ri anne had now been brought by degree ss o much into the habit of going out everyday that it was become a matter of indifference to her whether she went o rn o tan d she prepared quietly and mechanically forever y evenings engagement though without expecting the smallest amusement from any and very often without knowing till the last moment where it was to take her to her dress and appearances h ewa s grown so perfectly indifferent as not to bestow half the consideration on it during the whole of her to i let which it received from miss s tee le in the first five minutes of their being together when it was finished nothing escaped her minute observation and general curiosity she saw every thing and asked every thing was never easy till she knew the price of every part of ma ri anne s dress could have guessed the number of her gown s altogether with better judgment than ma ri anne herself and was not without hopes of finding out before they

in law who had preceded them to the house of her acquaintance and was there hoping for some delay on their part that might inconvenience either herself or her coachman the events of this evening were not very remarkable the party like other musical parties comprehended a great many people who had real taste forth e performance and a great many more who had none a tall and the performers themselves

lamenting the extreme ga uch eri e which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper society he candidly and generous ly attributed it much less to any natural deficiency than to the misfortune of a private education while he himself though probably without any particular any material superiority by nature merely from the advantage of a public school was a swell fitted tom i xi n the world as any other man upon my soul he added i believe i tis nothing more and s oi often tell my mother when she is griev ing about it my dear madam i always say to her you must make yourself easy the evil

more within my comprehension i understand you you do not suppose that i have ever felt much for four months ma ri anne i have had all this hanging on my mind without being at liberty to speak o fit to a single creature knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you yet unable to prepare you for i ti n the least it was told m ei tw a sin a manner forced on me by th every person herself whose pri or engagement ruined all my prospects and told m ea si thought with triumph this persons suspicions therefore i have had to oppose by endeavouring to appear

too well it has not been my only unhappiness if you can think me capable o fever feelings ur ely you may suppose that i have suffered now the composure of mind with which i have brought myself at present to consider the matter the consolation that i have been willing to admit have been the effect of constant and painful exertion they did not spring up of themselves they did not occur to

of an angel she says she never shall think well of any body again an done cannot wonder a ti t after beings o deceived meeting with such ingratitude wheres o much kindness had been shewn so much confidence had been placed it was quite out of the benevolence of her heart that she had asked these young women to her house merely because she thought they deserved some attention were harmless well

e dw ard said very little but what h edi d say wa sin them os t determined manner nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement he would stand to it cost him what it might then cried mrs j

little concern in the business a swell as yourself for l uc ys tee le is my cousin and i believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world nor o new ho more deserves a good husband john da sh

would by no means speak di s respectfully of any relation of yours madam miss l uc ys tee le is i dares aya very deserving young woman but in the present case you know the connect i on must be impossible and to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her uncle s care the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune as mrs fer r ars is perhaps altogether a little extraordinary in short i do not meant o reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom you have a regard form rs j en n ing s we all wish her extremely happy and mrs fer r ars s conduct throughout the

mrs j en n ing s they all joined in a very spirited cri ti qu e upon the party chapter mrs j en n ing s was very warm in her praise o fed w ard s conduct but only e li nor and ma ri anne understood its true merit they only knew how little he had had to tempt him to b edi s ob edi en tan d how small was the consolation beyond the consciousness of doing right that could remain to him in the loss of friends and fortune e li nor gloried in his integrity and ma ri anne forgave all his offences in compassion for his punishment but though confidence between them was by this public discovery restored to its proper state it was not a subject on which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone e li nor avoided it upon principle as t ending to fix still more upon her thoughts by the too warm too positive assurances of ma ri anne that belief o fed w ard s continued affection for herself which she rather wished to do away and ma ri anne s courage soon failed h eri n trying to converse upon a topic which always left her more di s satisfied with herself th a never by the comparison it necessarily produced between e li nor s conduct and hero wn she fel tall the force of that comparison but not a she r sister had hoped tour ge her to exertion now she felt it wit hall the pain of continual self reproach regretted most bitterly that she had never exerted herself before but it brought only the to r tu r eo f penitence without the hope of amendment her mind was so much weakened that she still fancied present exertion impossible and therefore it only di spirited her more nothing new was heard by them for a day or two afterwards of affairs in ha rle y street or bar t let ts building s but though so much of the matter was known to them already that mrs j en n ing s might have had e nought o do in spreading that knowledge farther without seeking after more she had resolved from the first top aya visit of comfort and inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could and nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual had prevented her going to them within that time the third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars was so fine so beautiful a sunday as to draw many token sing to n gardens though it was only the second week in march mrs j en n ing s and e li nor were of the number but ma ri anne who knew that the will ou ghb ys were again in town and had a constant dread of meeting them chose rather to stay at home than venture into so public a place an intimate acquaintance of mrs j en n ing s joined them soon after they entered the gardens and e li nor was not sorry that by her continuing with them and engaging all mrs j en n ing ss conversations h ewa s herself left to quiet reflections he saw nothing of the will ou ghb ys nothing o fed w

looking rather shy expressed great satisfaction in meeting them an don receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of mrs j en n ing s left hero wn party for a short time to join theirs mrs j

before t hems he had wander ed away to a subject on which e li nor had nothing to s aya nd therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to the first well but miss da sh wood speaking triumphantly people m ays ay what they ch us eabou t mr fer r ars s declaring he would not have lu cy for i tis no such thing i can tell you and i tis quite a shame for such ill natured reports to be spread abroad whatever lu cy might think about it herself you know it was no business of other people to set it down for certain i never heard anything of the kind hint e da t before i assure you said e li nor oh did not you but it was said i know very well and by more th a none for miss god by told miss s park s that nobody in their senses could expect mr fer r ars to give u pa woman like miss m or to n with thirty thousand pounds to her fortune for l uc ys tee le that had nothing a tall and ih adi t from miss s park s myself and besides that my cousin richard said himself that when it came to the point h ewa s afraid mr fer r ars would be off and when e dw ard did not come near us forth re e days i could not tell what to think myself and i believe in my heart lu cy gave i tu p all for lost for we came away from your brothers wednesday and we saw nothing of him no tall thurs day friday and saturday and did not know what was become of him once lu cy thought to write to him but then her spirits rose against that however this morning he came just as we came home from church and then i tall came out how he had been sent for wednesday to ha rle y street and been talked to by his mo the randall of them and how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but lu cy and nobody but lu cy would he have and how he had been so wo rr ied by what passed that as soon a she had went away from his m others house he had got upon his horse and ri dint o the country somewhere or other and how he had stayed about a tan inn all thurs d aya nd friday on purpose to get the better of i tan d after thinking it al lover and over again he said it seemed to him as if now he had no fortune and no nothing a tall it would be quite unkind to keep hero n to the engagement because it must be for her loss for he had nothing but two thousand pounds and no hope of anything else and if h ewa s to go into orders a she had some thoughts he could get nothing but acuracy and how was they t olive upon that he could not bear to think of her doing no better and s oh e begged if she had the least mind for i tt o put an end to the matter directly and leave him shift for himself i heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be and it was entirely for hers ake and upon her account that he said a word about being off and not upon his own i will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired of hero ro f wishing to marry miss m or to nor anything like it but to be sure lu cy would not give e art o such kind of talking so she told him directly with a great deal about sweet and love you know and all that oh la one can t repeat such kind of things you knows he told him directly she had not the least m in dint he world to be off for she could live with him upon a trifle and how little so ever he might have she should b every glad to have i tall you know or something of the kind so then h ewa sm on s tr ou s happy and talked on some ti m eabou t what they should do and they agreed he should take orders directly and they must wait to be married till he got a living and just then i could not hear any more form y cousin called from below to tell me mrs richardson was come in her coach and would take one of us token sing to n gardens so iwa s forced to go in t other oom an dint er r up t them to ask lu cy if she would like to go but sh edi d not care to leave e dw ard s oi just run upstairs and put on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the richardson sid o not understand what you mean by interrupting t hems aid e li nor you were all in the same room together were not you no indeed not us l amiss da sh wood do you think people make love when any body else is b yo h for shame to be sure you must know better than that laughing affectedly non o they were shut u pi n the drawing room together and all i heard was only by listening at the door how cried e li nor have you been repeating tom e what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door ia m sorry i did not know it before for i certainly would not have suffered y out o give me particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known yourself how could you behave s ou n fairly by your sister oh la there is nothing in that i only stood at the door and heard what i could and ia m sure lu cy would have done just the same b ym e for a year or two back when m art ha sharp e and i had so many secrets together she never made any bone s of hid ing in a closet or behind a chimney board on purpose to hear what we said e li nor tried total k of something else but miss s tee le could

indeed well said e li nor i tis a comfort to be prepared against the worst you have got your answer ready miss s tee l ewa s going to reply on the same subject but the approach of hero wn party made another more necessary oh la here come the richardson si had a vast deal more to say to you but i must not stay away from them no tan y longer i assure youth e yar every genteel people he makes am on

i wonder you was not afraid o fits being to rn such wa she r parting concern for after this she had time only top ay her fare well compliments tom rs j en n ing s before her company was claimed by mrs

send was all her communication and this produced from mrs j en n ing s the following natural remark wait for his having a living ay we all know how that will end they will wait a twelvemonth and finding no good comes o fit will set down upon acuracy of fifty pounds a year with the interest of his two thousand pounds and what little matter mrs tee lea n dm rp ra tt can give her then they will

ar every modest ia nt the least astonished a ti ti n the world for i have often thought of late there was nothing more likely to happen you judged from your knowledge of the colonel s general benevolence but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very soon occur opportunity repeated mrs j en n ing so has to that when a man has once made up his mind to such a thing somehow or other he will soon find an opportunity well my dear i wish you joy o fit again and again and i fever there was a happy couple in the world i think i shall soon know where to look forth em

did not quite understand the beginning of mrs j en n ing ss speech neither did she think it worth inquiring into and therefore only replied to its conclusion colonel b ran don is so delicate a man that he rather wished any one to announce his intentions tom r fer r ars than himself and so you are forced to do it well that is an odd kind of delicacy however i will not disturb you seeing her preparing to write you know your own concerns best so good b ym y dear i have not heard of anything to please m es o well since ch ar lot t ewa s brought to bed and a ways he went but returning again

of her perplexity that however difficult it might be to express herself properly by letter i tw a sat least preferable to giving the information by word of mouth when her visitor entered to force her

his knowing her to be acquainted with it which with the consciousness of what she had been thinking of and what she had to tell him made her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes he too was

he might have had such a living in his g if ta sa friend of mine of my family he may perhaps indeed i know he has still greater pleasure in bestow ing it but upon my word you owe nothing tom y solicitation truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action but shew a sat the same times o unwilling to appear as the b en e fact r ess o fed w ard that she acknowledged it with

colonel b ran don has given the living of de la ford to e dw ard really well this is very astonishing no relations hip no connect i on between them and now that living s fetch such a price what was the value of this about two hundred a year very well and forth e next present a ti on to a living of that value supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly and likely to va c ate it soon he might have got i dares ay fourteen hundred pounds and how came he not to have settled that matter before this persons death now indeed it would be too late to sell it but a man of colonel b ran don

however on recollection that the case may probably be this e dw ard is only to hold the living till the person to whom the colonel has really sold the present a ti on i sold e nought o take it aye aye that is the fact depend upon i te li nor contradicted it however very positively and by relating that she had herself been employed in conveying the offer from colonel b ran don to e dw ard and

kindly taking her hand and speaking in an awful whisper i may assure you and i will do it because i know it must gratify you i have good reason to think indeed i have it from the best authority o ri should not repeat it for otherwise it would b every wrong to say anything about it but i have it from th every best authority not that i ever precisely heard mrs fer r ars say it herself bu the r

any attachment you know it never could be all that is gone by but i thought i would just tell you of this because ikne w how much it must please you not that you have any reason to regret my dear e li

not allow the danger to be material and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment must procure with a confidence which in a less er degree was communicated to e li nor he promised to call

was easily pre determined by all for after ex p eri en c ing the blessings of one imprudent engagement contracted without his m others consent a she had already done for more than four years nothing

not be particularly told this only need be said that when they all sat down to table at four o clock about three hours after his arrival he had secured his lady engaged her m others consent and was not only in the rapturous profession of the lover but in the reality of reason and truth one of the happiest of men his situation indeed was more than commonly joyful he had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to swell his heart and raise his spirits h ewa s released without any reproach to himself from an en tan gl e men t which had long formed his misery from a woman whom he had long ceased to love and elevate da t once to that security with another which he must have thought of almost with despair as soon a she had learnt to consider it with desire h ewa s brought not from doubt or suspense but from misery to happiness and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine fl owing grateful cheerfulness as his friends had never witnessed in him before his heart wa snow o

had not event he nominal employment which belonging to th eun i vers i ty would have given me for iwa s not entered at oxford till iwa s nineteen i had therefore nothing in the world to do but to

by every argument in her power told him that in miss m or to n he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune and en forced the assertion by observing that miss m or to n was the daughter of a noble man with thirty thousand pounds while miss da sh wood was only the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than three but when she found that though perfectly admit t ing the truth of her
