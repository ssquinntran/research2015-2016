chapter i down the r abb i th o lea l ice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in i tan d what is the use o fa book thought al ice without pictures or conversations o shew as considering in hero wn mind a swell as she could forth e hot day made her feel very sleep y and stupid whether the pleasure of making a dai sy ch a in would be worth the trouble of getting up and pick ing the dai s ies when suddenly a white r abb it with pink eyes ran close by her there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did al ice think its o very much out of th ewa y to h earth er abb its ay to itself oh dear oh dear i shall be late when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time i tall seemed quite natural but when the r abb it actually took a watch out o fits wa is tc oa t pocket and looked a ti tan d then hurried on al ice started to her feet for i tf la she d across her mind that she had never be foreseen ar abb it with either a wa is tc oa t pocket o ra watch to take out o fi tan d burn ing with curiosity she ran across the field after i tan d fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a larger abb i th o le under the hedge in another moment down went al ice after it never once considering ho win the worlds h ewa s to get out again the r abb i th o le went st raight on like a tu nn elf or some w aya nd then d ipp ed suddenly down so suddenly that al ice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about he ran d to wonder what was going to happen next first she tried to look down and make out what shew as coming to but i tw a stood a rk to see anything then she looked at the side soft he well and noticed that they were filled with cu p boards and books he lves here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pe gs she took down ajar from one of the she lves as she passed it was la bell ed o range m arm a la d ebu tt o her great disappointment it was empty sh edi d not like to dropt h ej ar for fear o fk ill ing somebody so managed to put it into one of the cu p boards as she fell past it well thought al ice to herself after such a fall as this i shall think nothing of tu mbl ing downstairs how b rave they ll all think meat home why i would nt say anything about it even i fi fell off the top of the house which was very likely t rued own down down would the fall never come to an end i wonder how many miles i ve fallen by this times he said aloud i must be getting somewhere n earth e centre of the earth let me see that would be four thousand miles down i think for you see al ice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and thought his was not a very good opportunity for sh owing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her still it was good practice to say i to very es that s about the right distance but then i wonder what la ti tu d eo r long i tu d ei ve got to al ice had no idea what la ti tu d ewa so r long i tu de either but thought they were nice grand words to say presently she began again i wonder i fi shall fall right through the earth how fu nn yi tl l seem to come out among the people that walk with their head s down w ard the an ti path ies i thinks h ewa s rather glad there was no one listening this time a sit did nt sound a tall the right word but i shall have to ask them what then a me of the country is you know please ma a mis this new zeal and o ra us tr a lia and she tried to curt se ya s she spoke fancy curt se y ing as your e falling through the air do you think you could manage i tan d what an ignorant little girls he ll think me for asking n oi tl l never do to ask perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere down down down there was nothing else to do so al ice soon began talking again di n ah ll miss m every much to night i should think di n ah was the ca ti hope they ll remember hers a uc ero f milk at tea timed in ah my dear i wish you were down here with me there are n om ice in the a iri m afraid bu tyo u might catch a ba tan d that s very like a mo use you know but do ca t seat ba ts i wonder and here al ice began to get rather sleep y and went on saying to herself in a dream y sort of way do ca t seat ba ts do ca t seat ba ts and sometimes do ba t seat ca ts for you see as she could nt answer either question it did nt much matter which ways he put its he felt that shew a sd oz ing off and had just begun to dreamt hat shew as walking hand in hand with di na hand saying to her very earnestly now di n ah tell met he truth did you ever eat a ba t when suddenly t hum pt hum p down she came upon a heap o fs ti cks and dry leaves and the fall was over al ice was not a bit hurt and she jumped upon to her feet in a moments he looked up but it was all dark over head before her was another long passage and the white r abb it was still insight hurrying down it there was not a moment to be lost away went al ice like the wind and was just in time to hear its aya sit turned a corner oh m years and whi sk er show late its getting shew as close behind it when she turned the corner but the r abb it was no longer to be seen she found herself in along low hall which was li tu pb ya row of lamp s hanging from t hero of there were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and when al ice had been all th ewa yd ow none s idea n du p the other trying every doors he walked sadly down the middle wondering hows h ewa s ever to get out again suddenly she came upon a little three leg ge d table all made o fs o lid glass there was nothing on it except a ti ny gold en key and al ice s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall but alas either the lock s were too large or the key was too small but a tan y rate it would not open any of them however on the second time round she came upon a low curtains he had not noticed before and behind it was a little door about fi f tee n inch es high she tried the little gold en key in the lock and to her great delight it fitted al ice opened the door and found that i tl e dint oa small passage not much larger than a ra th o les he knelt down and looked along the passage into the love lies t garden you e vers aw hows he longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fo un ta in s but she could note v en get her head through the door w aya nd even if my head would go through thought poor al ice it would b eo f very little use without my shoulders oh how i wish i could shut up like ate les cope i think i could i fi only know how to begin for you sees o many out of th ewa y things had happened lately that al ice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible there seemed to b en o use in waiting by the little doors o she went back to the table half hoping she might find another key on i to ra tan y rate a book of rules for shut t ing people up like te les cope s this times he found a little bot tl eo n it which certainly was no there before said al ice and round the neck of the bot tl ewa sa paper la b el with the words drink me beautifully pri n ted on i ti n large letters it was all very well to say drink m ebu t the wise little al ice was not going to do that in a hurry no ill look first she said and see whether its marked poison or not for she ha dread several nice little hi stories about children who had got burn tan d eaten u pb y wild b east s and other unpleasant things all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them such as that a red hot poke r will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife it usually b le ed s and she had never forgotten that if you drink much from abo tt le marked poison i tis almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later however this bot tl ewa s not marked poison so al ice ventured to taste i tan d finding it very nice i th adi n fact a sort of mixed flavour o fc he rry tart custard pi ne apple roast tu r key t off ee and hot b uttered to as ts h every soon finished it off what a curious feelings aid al ice i must be shut t ing up like ate les cope and so it was indeed shew a snow only ten inch es high and her face brightened u pa t the thought that shew a snow the rights ize for going through the little door into that lovely garden first however she waited for a few minutes to see if shew as going to shr in k any further she felt a little nervous about this for it might end you knows aid al ice to herself in my going out altogether like a can d le i wonder what i should be like then and she tried to fancy what the flame o fa can d le is like after the can d le is blown out for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing after a while finding that nothing more happened she decided on going into the garden at once but alas for poor al ice when she got to the doors h ef ounds he had forgotten the little gold en key and when she went back to the table for its h ef ounds he could not possibly reach its he could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to c limb upon eo f the leg soft he table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little things at down and cried come there sn o use in c ryi ng like that said al ice to herself rather sharp ly i advise y out o leave off this minutes he generally gave herself very good advice though sh every seldom followed i tan d sometimes she scolded herself so severe ly as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered trying to box hero w near s for having c heated herself in a game o fc ro qu et shew as playing against herself forth is curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people but its no use now thought poor al ice to pretend to be two people why there s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable persons oo n here ye fell on a little glass box that wa sly ing under the tables he opened i tan d found in i ta very small cake on which the words eat me were beautifully marked in currants well il lea ti t said al ice and i fit makes me grow larger i can reach the key and i fit makes me grow smaller i can creep under the doors o either way ill get into the garden an did on t care which happens s heat ea little bi tan d said anxiously to herself which way which way holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which w ayi t was growing and shew as quite surprise d to find that she remained the same size to be sure this generally happens wh e none eats cake but al ice had got so much into th ewa yo f expecting nothing but out of th ewa y things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go o ninth e common ways o she set to work and very soon finished off the cake chapter ii the po o lo f tears curious e ran d curious er cried al ice shew a ss o much surprise d that forth e moments he quite forgot how to speak good english now im opening out like the largest te les cope t hate ver was good bye feet for when she looked down a the r feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting sofa r off oh my poor little feet i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears im sure shan tb e able i shall b ea great dealt oo far off to trouble myself about you you must manage the best way you can but i must be kind to them thought al ice or perhaps they wo nt walk th ewa yi want to go let me see ill give them a new pair of boot s every christmas and she went on planning to herself hows he would manage it they must go by the car rier she thought and how fu nn yi tl l seem sending presents to ones own feet and how odd the directions will look al ice s right foot esq h earth rug n earth ef end er with al ice s love oh dear what nonsense im talking just then her head struck against t hero o fo f the hall in facts h ewa snow more than nine feet h ig hands heat once took up the little gold en key and hurried off to the garden door poor al ice it was as much as she could d oly ing down o none side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more hopeless th a never she sat down and began to cry again you ought to be ashamed of yourself said al ice a great girl like you she might well say this to go on c ryi n gi n this way stopt his moment i tell you but she went on all the same shedding g all on so f tears un ti l there was a large po ol all round her about four inch es deep and reaching half down the hall after a times he heard a little pa tt e ring of feet in the distance and she hastily dr ied her eyes to see what was coming it was the white r abb it returning sp l end idly dressed with a pair of white ki d gloves i none hand and a large fa ninth e other he came tr o tt ing along in a great hurry muttering to himself a she came oh the d uch ess the d uch ess oh wo nt she b es ava ge i five kept her waiting al ice felt so desperate that shew as ready to ask help of any ones o when the r abb it came near hers he began in a low timid voice if you pleases ir the r abb it started violent ly dropped the white ki d gloves and the fa n and sku rr ied away into the dark ness as hard a she could go al ice took up the fa n and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fa nni ng herself all the times he went on talking dear dear how queer every thing is to d aya nd yesterday things went on just as usual i wonder i five been changed in the night let me think wa sit he same when i got up this morning i almost think i can remember feeling a little different but i fi m not the same the next question is who in the world a mi ah that s the great puzzle and she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself to see if she could have been changed fo ran yo f them im sure im not a da she said for her hair goes in such long ring lets and mine does nt go in ring lets a tall an dim sure i can tb e ma b elf o ri kn o wall sorts of things and she oh she knows such a very little besides she s she an dim i and oh dear how puzzling i tall is ill try i fi kn o wall the things i used to know let me see four times five is twelve and four times six is thirteen and four times seven i so h dear i shall never get to twenty at that rate however them ult ip lic a ti on table does nt signify lets try geography london is the capital of par is and par i si s the capital o from e and ro men o that s all wrong im certain i must have been changed form ab el ill try and say how doth the little and she crossed her hands on her la pa si f she were saying lessons and began to repeat i tb u the r voice sounded hoarse and strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do how doth the little cr oco d ile improve his shi n ing ta i land pour the waters of then ile on every gold en scale how cheerfully he seems to gr in how neatly spread his c law s and welcome little fish e sin with gently smiling ja w si m sure those are not the right words said poor al ice and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on i must be ma b el after al land i shall have to go and live in that pok y little house and have next to not o ys to play wi than do he vers o many lessons to learn n oi ve made up my mind about i ti f imm ab el ill stay down here i tl lb en o use their putting their head s down and saying come up again dear i shall only look up and say who a mi then tell me that first and then i fi like being that person ill come u pi fn o till stay down here till im somebody else but oh dear cried al ice with a sudden burst of tears i do wish they would put their head s down ia ms o very tired of being all alone here as she said this she looked down a the r hands and was surprise d to see that she had put o none of the r abb its little white ki d gloves while shew as talking how can i have done that she thought i must be growing small a gains he got up and went to the table to measure herself b yi tan d found that as nearly as she could guess shew a snow about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly she soon found out that the cause of this was the fa n shew as holding and she dropped it hastily just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether that was a narrow escape said al ice a good deal frightened at the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence and now forth e garden and she ran wit hall speed back to the little door but alas the little door was shut again and the little gold en key wa sly ing on the gl as stable as before and things are worse th a never thought the poor child for i never was so small as this before never and i declare its too bad that i tis as she said these words her foot s lip peda ndi n another moments p la sh shew a sup to h erc h in in salt water her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into these aa n dint hat case i can go back by rai l ways he said to herself al ice had been to the seaside once in her life and had come to the general conclusion that wherever you got oo n the english coast you find a number of bathing m ach i nes in these a some children dig g ing in the s and with wood en spa d es then a row of lodg ing houses and behind them a rai l way station however she soon made out that shew a sin the po o lo f tears which she had wept when shew as nine feet high i wish i had nt cried so much said al ice as she sw am about trying to find her way out i shall b ep un i she d for it now i suppose by being drowned in my own tears that will b ea queer thing to be sure however every thing is queer to day just then she heard something sp la shi ng about in the po o la little way off and she sw am nearer to make out what i tw a sat first she thought it must b ea wa lru so rh ipp op ota mu s but then she remembered how small shew a snow and she soon made out that it was only a mo use that had sl ipp edi n like herself would i tb eo f any use now thought al ice to speak to this mo use every thing i ss o out of th ewa y down here that i should think very likely it can talk a tan y rate there sn o harm in trying so she began o mo used o you know th ewa y out of this po o lia m very tired o fs w imm ing about here o mo u sea l ice thought this must b eth e right way of speaking to a mo use she had never done such a thing before but she remembered having seen in her brothers la t ing ra m ma ra mo use o famous e to a mo u sea mo use o mo use them o use looked a the r rather in qui sit i vel y and seemed to her to wink with one o fits little eyes but it said nothing perhaps it does nt understand english thought al ice i dares ay its a french mo use come over with william th eco n qu ero r for wit hall her knowledge of history al ice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened so she began again ou es tm a chat te which was the first sentence in her french lesson book them o use gave a sudden lea p out of the water and seemed to qui ver al lover with fright oh i beg your pardon cried al ice hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor an i ma ls feelings i quite forgot you did nt like ca ts not like ca ts cried them o use i nash r ill passion ate voice would you like ca ts if you were me well perhaps not said al ice in a soothing tone don tb e angry about i tan d yet i wish i could show you our ca td in a hi think you d take a fancy to ca ts if you could only see hers h ei s such a dear quiet thing al ice went on half to herself as she sw am la z ily about in the po o lands he sit s pur ring so nicely by the fi relic king her pa ws and washing her face and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse and she s such a capital one for catching m ice oh i beg your pardon cried al ice again forth is time them ou s ewa sb ri s tl ing al lover and she felt certain it must be really offended w ew on t talk about he ran y more if you d rather not we indeed cried them o use w how as trembling down to the end of his t ail a si fi would talk on such a subject our family always hated ca ts n as ty low vulgar things don t let me h earth e name again i wo nt indeed said al ice in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation are you are you fond o fo f dog s them o used id not answers oa l ice went on eagerly there is such a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you a little bright ey edt er rier you know with oh such long curl y brown hair and i tl l fetch things when youth row them and i tl l sit up and beg for its d inn e randalls or ts of things i can t remember half of them and it belongs to a farmer you know and he says its so useful its worth a hundred pounds he says i tk ill s all the ra ts and oh dear cried al ice in a sorrowful tone im afraid i ve offended it again forth e mo us ewa ss w imm ing away from her as hard a sit could go and making quite a com motion in the po o la sit went so she called softly after i tm o used e ard o come back again and w ew on t talk about ca ts or dog s either if you don t like them when them o use heard this it turned round and sw am slowly back to h eri ts face was quite pale with passion al ice thought and it said in a low trembling voice let us get to the sho re and then ill tell you my history and y oul l understand why i tis i hate ca ts and dog sit was high time to go forth ep oo l was getting quite crowded with the bird s and an i ma ls that had fallen into it there were a du ck and a do do a lo rya nda n ea g let and several other curious creatures al ice l edt h ew aya nd the whole party sw am to the sho re chapter iii a ca u cu sr a cea nd along ta le they were indeed a queer looking party that assembled on the bank the bird s with d ra gg led f eat hers the an i ma ls with their fu r clinging closet o them and all dr ipp ing wet cross and uncomfortable the first question of course wa show to get dry again they had a consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to al ice to find herself talking familiar ly with them a si f she had known them all her life indeed she had quite along argument with the lo ry who at last turned su lk y and would only say ia m older than you and must know better and this al ice would not allow without knowing how old it was and as the lo

you dry e nought h ey all sat down at once in a larger ing with them o use in the middle al ice k ep there yes anxiously fixed on it for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold i fs h edi d not get dry very soon a hems aid them o use wi than important air are you all ready this is the dr ies t thing i know silence all round if you please william th eco n qu ero r whose cause was favour ed by the

rather cross ly of course you know what it means i know what it means well enough when i find a things aid the du ck its generally a fro go ra wo rm the question is what did the arch bi shop find them o used id not notice this question but hurried ly went on found it advisable to go with e dga ra the l ing to meet william and offer him the crown william s conduct at first was moderate but the insolence of his nor man sho ware you getting on now my dear it continued turning to al ice a sit spoke as wet a se vers aid al ice in a melancholy tone it does nt seem to dry me a tall in that cases aid the do do solemnly rising to its feet i move that the meeting a djo u rn forth e immediate adoption of more energetic re me dies speak english said the ea g let i don t know the meaning of half those long words and what s more i don t believe you do either and the ea g let bent down its head to h idea smiles o me of the other bird s ti t ter ed audibly what iwa s going to says aid the do do in an offended tone was that the best thing to get us dry would b ea ca u cu sr a ce what i sa ca u cu sr a ce said al ice not that she wanted much to know but the do do had paused a si fit thought that somebody ought to speak and no one else seemed inclined to say anything why said the do doth e best way to explain i tis to do i tan da s you might like to try the thing yourself some winter day i will tell you how the do do managed it first it marked out a ra ce course in a sort of circle the exact shape does nt matter it said and then all the party were placed along the course here and there there was no one two three and away but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that it was note a sy to know when the ra c ewa s over however when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the do do suddenly called out the ra c ei s over and they all crowded round it pan t ing and asking but who has wo n this question the do do could not answer without a great deal of thought and its at for along time with one finger pressed upon its fore head the po sit io n in which you usually see shakespeare in the pictures of him while there st waited in silence at last the do do said every body has wo n and all must have prize s but who is to give the prize s quite ach o ru so f voices asked why she of courses aid the do do pointing to al ice with one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her calling out in a confused way prize s prize sa l ice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand in her pocket and pu l led out abo xo f com fits luck ily the salt water had not got into i tan d handed them round as prize s there was exactly one apiece all round but she must have a prize herself you knows aid them o use of course the do do replied very gravely w hate l se have you got in your pocket he went on turning to al ice only at him b le said al ice sadly hand it over here said the do do then they all crowded round hero nce more while the do do solemnly presented the t him b le saying we beg your acceptance of this elegant t him b lea nd when it had finished this short speech they all cheer ed al ice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked so grave that sh edi d not dare to laugh and as she could not think of anything to says he simply bowed and took the t him b le looking as solemn as she could the next thing was to eat th eco m fits this cause d some noise and confusion as the large bird s complained that they could not taste theirs and the small ones ch ok ed and had to b epa t ted on the back however it was over a tl a stand they sat down again in a ring and begged them ou set o tell them something more you promised to tell me your history you knows aid al ice and why i tis you hate can dd she added in a whisper half afraid that it would be offended again mine is along and a sad ta le said them o use turning to al ice and sighing i tis along t ail certainly said al ice looking down with wonder at them o use st ail but why do you call its ad and she kept on puzzling about it while them ou s ewa s speaking so that he ride a of the ta l ewa s something like this fu ry said to a mo u set ha them e ti n the house let us both got o law i will prose cut e you come ill taken o denial we must have a trial for really this morning i ve nothing to do said them ou

very an g rily ak not said al ice always ready to make herself useful and looking anxiously about hero h do let me help t ound oi ti shall do nothing of the sorts aid them o use getting up and walking away you insult me by talking such nonsense i did nt mean it plea d ed poor al ice but your e so easily offended you know them o use only grow l edi n reply please come back and finish your story al ice called after i tan d the others all joined inch o ru s yes pleased o but them o use only shook its head im patiently and walked a little quicker what a pity it would nt stay sighed the lo rya s soon a sit was quite out of sight and an old c ra b took the opportunity of saying to her daughter ah my dear let this b ea lesson to you never to lose your temper hold your tongue ma said the young c

who i sd in a hi fi might venture to ask the questions aid the lo rya l ice replied eagerly for shew as always ready total k about her pet di n ah sour ca tan d she s such a capital one for catching m ice you can t think and oh i wish you could see her after the bird s why she l lea ta little bird as soon as look a ti t this speech cause da remarkable sensation among the party some of the bird s hurried of fat once one old ma gp ie began wrap p ing itself up very carefully re marking i really must be getting home the night air does nt suit my throat and a can ary called out in a trembling voice to its children come away my dears its high time you were all in bed on various pre texts they all moved off and al ice was soon left alone i wish i had nt mentioned di n ah she said to herself in a melancholy tone nobody seems to like her down here an dim sure she s the best ca ti n the world oh my dear di na hi wonder i fi shall e verse e you any more and here poor al ice began to cry again for she felt very lonely and low spirited in a little while however she again heard a little pa tt e ring of footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly half hoping that them o use had changed his mind and was coming back to finish his story chapter iv the r abb it sends in a little b ill it was the white r abb i tt ro tt ing slowly back again and looking anxiously about a sit went a si fit had lost something and she heard it muttering to itself the d uch ess the d uch ess oh my dear pa w so h my fu ran d whi sk ers she ll get me exe cu ted assure as fer re ts a refer re ts where can i have dropped them i wonder al ice guessed in a moment that it was looking forth e fa n and the pair of white ki d gloves and sh every goodnatured ly began hunting about forth em but they were nowhere to be seen every thing seemed to have changed since hers wi mi n the po o land the great hall with the gl as stable and the little door had vanish ed completely very soon the r abb it noticed al ice as she went hunting about and called out to h eri n an angry tone why ma rya nn what are you doing ou there run home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fa n quick now and al ice was so much frightened that she ran of fat once in the direction it pointed to without trying to explain the mistake it had made he took me for his housemaid she said to herself as she ran how surprise dh el lb e when he finds out who ia m but id better take him his fa n and gloves that i si fi can find them as she said this she came upon a neat little house on the door of which was a bright b ra ss p late with then a me wr abb i ten g raved upon its he went in without knock ing and hurried upstairs in great fe a rles t she should meet there a lm ary anna n db e turned out of the house before she had found the fa n and gloves how queer it seems al ice said to herself to be going messages for ar abb i ti supposed in a hl lb e sending me on messages next and she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen miss al ice come here directly and get ready for your walk coming in a minute nurse but i ve got to see that them o used oe sn t get out only i don t think al ice went on that they d let di n ah stop in the house i fit began order ing people about like that by this times he had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window an don i ta s she had hoped a fa n and two or three p airs of ti ny white ki d gloves she took up the fa n and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave t hero om when here ye fell upon a little bot tl e that stood n earth e looking glass there was no la b el this time with the words drink m ebu t never the less she un co rk edi tan d put i tt o her lips i know something interesting is sure to happens he said to herself whenever i eat or drink anything so ill just see what this bot tl e does i do hope i tl l make me grow large again for really im quite tired of beings u chat in y little thing it did so indeed and much sooner than she had expected before she had drunk half the bot t les he found her head pressing against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken she hastily put down the bot tl e saying to herself that s quite enough i hope i shan t grow any more a sit i si can t get out at the door i do wish i had nt drunk quite so much alas it was too late to wish that she went on growing and growing and very soon had to knee l down on the floor in another minute there was note v en room forth is and she tried the effect o flying down with one elbow against the door and the other arm curled round her head still she went on growing and as alas t resources h ep u tone arm out of the window an done foot up the chimney and said to herself now i can don o more whatever happens what will become of me luck ily for al ice the little ma gi c bot tl e had now had its full effect and she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable and as there seemed to b en o sort of chance of her ever getting out o ft hero om again no wonders he felt unhappy it was much pleasanter at home thought poor al ice wh e none was nt always growing larger and smaller and being ordered about b ym ice and r abb its i almost wish i had nt gone down that r abb i th o lea nd ye tan d yet its rather curious you know this sort of life i do wonder what can have happened tom e when i used to read fairy ta les i fancied that kind of thing never happened and nowhere ia mi n the middle of one there ought to b ea book written about me that there ought and when i grow up ill write one but im grown up now she added in a sorrowful tone at least there sn o room to grow up any more here but then thought al ice shall i never ge tan y older than ia m now that l lb ea comfort o new ay never to b ea n old woman but then always to have lessons to learn oh i should nt like that oh you foolish al ice she answered herself how can you learn lessons in here why there s hardly room for you and no room a tall fo ran y lesson books and so she went on taking fir stone s idea nd then the other and making quite a conversation o fit altogether but after a few minutes she heard a voice out s idea nd stopped to listen ma rya nn ma rya nn said the voice fetch me my gloves this moment then came a little pa tt e ring of feet on the stairs al ice knew it was the r abb it coming to look for he ran d she trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that shew a snow about a thousand times as large as the r abb i tan d had no reason to be afraid o fit presently the r abb it came up to the door and tried to open it but as the door opened inward s and al ice s elbow was pressed hard against it that attempt proved a failure al ice heard its ay to itself then ill go round and get in at the window that you wo nt thought al ice and after waiting till she fancied she heard the r abb it just under the windows he suddenly spread out her hand and made a sn a tc hint he airs h edi d not get hold of anything but she heard a little shr i eka nda fall and ac ra sho f broken glass from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into acu cumb er frame or something of the sort next ca mean angry voice the r abb it spa tp at where are you and then a voices he had never heard before sure then im here dig g ing for apples ye r honour dig g ing for apples indeed said the r

whoever saw one that size why it fills the whole windows ur ei t does ye r honour but its an arm for all that well its got no business there a tan y rate go and take it away there was along silence after this and al ice could only hear whispers now and then such assure i don t like i ty er honour a tall a tall do a si tell you you cow ard and at lasts he spread out her hand again and made another sn a tc hint he air this time there were two little shr i eks and more sounds of broken glass what a number o fc u cumb er frame s there must be thought al ice i wonder what they l ld o next as for pulling me out of the window i only wish they could im sure i don t want to stay in here any longer she waited for some time without hearing anything more at last came a ru mbl ing of little cart wh e els and the sound o fa good many voices all talking together she made out the words wheres the other l add er why i had n tt o bring bu tone b ill s got the other b ill f etc hither e la dh

for a good dealt his fire place is narrow to be sure but i think i can kic ka little she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little an i ma l she could nt guess of what sort it was sc ra tc h ing and sc rambling about in the chimney close above her then saying to herself this i sb ill she gave one sharp kic k and waited to see what would happen next the first things he heard was a general ch o ru so f there goes b ill then the r abb its voice along catch him you by the hedge then silence and then another confusion of voices hold up his head b ran dy now don tc ho ke him how was i told fellow what happened to you tell us all about it last came a little feeble s quea king voice that sb ill thought al ice well i hardly known o more thank ye im better now but i ma dealt oo fl us ter edt o tell you all i know is something comes a tm e like a ja c ki n the box and u pi goes like a sky rock e ts o you did old fellows aid the others we must burn the house down said the r abb its voice and al ice called out as loud as she could if you do ill set di na hat youth er ewa sa dead silence instantly and al ice thought to herself i wonder what they will do next if they had any sense they d take t hero of off after a minute or two they began moving about again and al ice heard the r abb its aya b arrow ful will do to begin with ab arrow ful of what thought al ice but she had not long to doubt forth e next moment a shower of little p eb b les came ra tt l ing in at the window and some of them hither in the face ill put a stopt o this she said to herself and sho u ted out you d better not do that again which produced another dead silence al ice noticed with some surprise that the p eb b les were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head i fi ea tone of these cakes she thought its sure to makes o me change in my size and a sit can t possibly make me larger it must make me smaller i supposes o she sw allowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly as soon as shew as small e nought o get through the doors he ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little an i ma ls and bird s waiting out side the poor little li z ard b ill wa sin the middle being held u pb y two guinea pi gs who were giving it something out of abo tt le they all ma dear us hat al ice the moments he appeared but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a thick wood the first thing i ve got to do said al ice to herself as she wander ed about in the wood is to grow tom y rights ize again and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden i think that will b eth e best plan it sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and simply arranged the only difficulty was that she had not the smallest idea how to set about i tan d while shew a sp ee ring about anxiously among the trees a little sharp bar k just over her head made her look u pi na great hurry an enormous puppy was looking down a the r with larger ound eyes and feebly stretching ou tone pa w trying to touch her poor little things aid al ice in a co ax ing tone and she tried hard to whist let o it but shew as terribly frightened all the ti meat the thought that it might be hungry in which case it would b every likely to ea the ru pi n spite o fall h erc oa x ing hardly knowing what sh edi d she pick ed u pa little bit o fs t ick and held it out to the puppy where upon the puppy jumped into the air of fall its feet at once with aye lp of delight and rushed at the st ick and made believe to worry it then al ice do d ge d behind a great this t let o keep herself from being run over and the moments he appeared on the others id eth e puppy made another rush at the st ick and tu mb led head over he el sin its hurry to get hold o fit then al ice thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart horse and expecting every moment to be tr ample d under its feet ran round the this tl e again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the st ick running a very little way forwards each ti mean d along way back and bar king hoarse ly all the while till at last its at down a good way off pan t ing with its tongue hanging out o fits mouth and its great eyes half shut this seemed to al ice a good opportunity for making her escape so she set of fat once and ran till shew as quite tired and out of breath and till the puppy s bar k sounded quite faint in the distance and yet what a dear little puppy it was said al ice as she lea nt against a butter cu p to rest herself and f anne d herself with one of the leaves i should have liked teaching it tricks very much i fi fi d only been the rights ize to do i to h dear id nearly forgotten that i ve got to grow up again let me see how i sit to be managed i suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other but the great question is what the great question certainly was what al ice looked all round her at the flowers and the b la de so f gr a ss but sh edi d not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances there was a large mu

the top o fits he stretch ed herself upon ti p to e and peeped over the ed ge of them u sh room and her eyes immediately met those o fa large ca ter p ill ar that was sitting on the top with its arms

opening for a conversation al ice replied rather shy ly ii hardly knows ir just at present at least i know who iwa s when i got up this morning but i think i must have been changed several times since then what do you mean by that said the ca ter pillars ter n ly explain yourself i can t explain myself im afraid sir said al ice because im not myself you see i don t sees aid the ca ter p ill a ri m afraid i can t put it more clearly al ice replied very polite ly for i can t understand it myself to begin wi than d beings o many different size sin a day is very co nf using i tis nt said the ca ter

i ta little queer wo n tyo u not a bit said the ca ter p ill ar well perhaps your feelings may be different said al ice all i know i sit would feel very queer tom e you said the ca ter p ill ar contemptuous ly who are you which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation al ice felt a little irritated at the ca ter pillars making such very short remarks and she drew herself up and said very gravely i think you ought to tell me who you are first why said the ca ter p ill ar here was another puzzling question and a sa l ice could not think of any good reason and as the ca

turned and came back again keep your tempers aid the ca ter p ill a ri s th a tall said al ice sw allowing down her anger a swell as she could no said the ca ter p ill a ra l ice thoughts he might a

ill kic k you downstairs that is not said rights aid the ca ter p ill ar not quite right im afraid said al ice timid ly some of the words have got altered i tis wrong from beginning to end said the ca

only one does nt like changing so often you know i don t knows aid the ca ter p ill a ra l ice said nothing she had never been so much contradicted in her life before and she felt that shew as losing

them u sh room and c ra w led away in the gr a ss merely re marking a sit w en tones i de will make you grow taller and the others i de will make you grow short er ones id eo f what the others id eo f what thought al ice to herself of them u sh rooms aid the ca ter p ill ar just a si f she had asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight al ice remained looking thoughtfully at them u sh room for a minute trying to make out which were the two side so fi tan da sit was perfectly round she found this a very difficult question however at lasts he stretch ed her arms round i ta s far as they would go and broke off a bit of the ed ge with each hand and now which is which she said to herself and n ib b led a little of the right hand bit to try the effect the next moments he felt a violent blow under neat hh erc h in it had struck her foot shew a sa good deal frightened by this very sudden change but she felt that there was no time to be lost as shew as shrinking rapidly so she set to work at once to eats o me of the other bit h erc h in was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth but sh edi di ta tl a stand managed to sw allow a mo r se lo f the lef than d bit come my head s free at lasts aid al ice in a tone of delight which changed into alarm in another moment when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found all she could see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which seemed to rise like as talk out o fa sea of green leaves that lay far below her what can all that green st uff be said al ice and where have my shoulders got to and oh my poor hands how i sit i can t see you shew as moving them about as she spoke but no results e em edt o follow except a little shaking among the distant green leaves as there seemed to b en o chance of getting her hands up to her head she tried together head down to them and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction li k ease r pent she had just succeeded in cur v ing it down into a graceful zi g za g and was going to di v ei n among the leaves which she found to be nothing but the top soft he trees under which she had been wandering when a sharp his s made her drawback in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and was b eating her violent ly with its win gs se r pent scream edt he pigeon im not a se r

nt the least idea what your e talking about said al ice i ve tried t hero o ts of trees and i ve tried bank s and i ve tried hedges the pigeon went on without attending to her but those se r pent s there sn o pleasing them al ice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the pigeon had finished a si fit was nt trouble enough hat ch ing the eggs said the pigeon but i must b eo n the look out for se r pent s night and day why i have nt had a wink of sleep these three weeks im very sorry you ve been an no ye d said al ice w how as beginning to see its meaning and just a sid taken the highest tree in the wood continued the pigeon raising its voice to a shr i eka nd just as iwa s thinking i should be free of them at last they must needs come w ri gg l ing down from the sky u gh se r pent but im not a se r pent i tell you said al ice i ma i ma well what are you said the pigeon i can see your e trying to invent something ii ma little girls aid al ice rather doubtfully as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that d aya likely story indeed said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest co n tempt i ve seen a good many little girls in my time but never one with such a neck as that non o your ease r pent and there sn o use denying i ti suppose y oul lb e telling me next that you never taste da n egg i have taste d eggs certainly said al ice w how a sa very truth ful child but little girls eat eggs quite as much a ss er pent sd o you know i don t believe it said the pigeon but if they do why then they r ea kind o fs er pent that s all i can say this was such a new idea to al ice that shew as quite silent for a minute or two which gave the pigeon the opportunity of adding your e looking for eggs i know that well enough and what does it matter tom e whether your ea little girl o ra se r pent it matters a good dealt o me said al ice hastily but im not looking for eggs a sit happens and if iwa si should nt want yours i don t like them ra w well be off then said the pigeon in a su lk y tone a sit settled down again into its nes ta l ice c ro uch ed down among the trees a swell as she could for her neck kept getting entangled among the branch es and every now and then she had to stop and un tw is ti t after a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mu sh room in her hands and she set to work very carefully n ib bl ing first a tone and then at the other and growing sometimes taller and sometimes short e run ti l she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height it was so long since she had been anything n earth e rights ize that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to i ti na few minutes and began talking to herself as usual come there s half my plan done now how puzzling all these changes are im never sure what im going to be from one minute to another however i ve got back tom y rights ize the next thing is to get into that beautiful garden how is that to be done i wonder as she said this she came suddenly upon an open place with a little house in it about four feet high whoever lives there thought al ice i tl l never do to come upon them this size why i should frighten them out of their wit ss o she began n ib bl ing at the right hand bit again and did not venture to go n earth e house till she had brought herself down to nine inch es high chapter vi pi g and p ep per for a minute or two she stood looking at the house and wondering what to do next when suddenly a foot man in li very came running out of the woods he considered him to b ea foot man because h ewa sin li very otherwise judging by his face only she would have called him a fi shan d ra p ped loudly at the door with his kn u ckles it was opened by another foot man in li very with around face and large eyes like a fro g and both foot men al ice noticed had pow de red hair that curled al lover their head s she felt very curious to know what it was all about and cr ep ta little way out of the wood to listen the fish foot man began by producing from under hi sar ma great letter nearly as large as himself and this he handed over to the others ayi n gi na solemn tone forth ed uch ess an invitation from the queen to play c ro qu et the fro g foot man repeated in the same solemn tone only changing the order of the words a little from the queen an invitation forth ed uch ess to play c ro qu et then they both bowed lo wan d their curls got entangled together al ice laughed so much at this that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing he ran d when she next peeped out the fish foot man was gone and the other was sitting on the ground n earth e doors ta ring stupid ly up into the sky al ice went timid ly up to the door and knocked there sn o sort of use in knock ing said the foot man and that for two reasons first because i month e same side of the door as you are secondly because they re making such a noise in side no one could possibly hear you and certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within a constant how l ing and sn e ezi ng and every now and then a great c ra s has i fa dish o rk ettle had been broken to pieces please then said al ice how a mi to get in there might be some sense in your knock ing the foot man went on without attending to h eri f we had the door between us for instance if you were in side you might knock and i could let you out you know h ewa s looking up into the sky all the time h ewa s speaking and this al ice thought decidedly uncivil but perhaps he can t help its he said to herself his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head but a tan y rate he might answer questions how a mi to get in she repeated aloud i shall si there the foot man remark ed till to morrow at this moment the door of the house opened and a large p late came sk imm in gout st raight at the foot man s head it just gr a ze d his no sea nd broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him or next day may b eth e foot man continued in the same tone exactly a si f nothing had happened how a mi to get in asked al ice again in a louder tone are y out o get in a tall said the foot man that s the first question you know it was no doubt only a lic edi d not like to be told so its really dreadful she m uttered to herself th ewa y all the creatures ar gu e its e nought o drive one c ra zy the foot man seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark with variations i shall si there he said on and off for days and days but what a mi to do said al ice anything you likes aid the foot man and began whist l ing oh there sn o use in talking to him said al ice desperately h es perfectly id ioti can d she opened the door and went in the door led right into a large kitchen which was full of smoke from one end to the other the d uch ess was sitting on a three leg ge ds too li n the middle nur sing a baby the cook was leaning over the fire stirring a large ca u ld ro n which seemed to be full of soup there s certainly too much p ep p eri n that soup al ice said to herself a swell as she could for sn e ezi ng there was certainly too much o fit in the air event h ed

large ca t which was sitting on the h earth and gr i nni ng from e art o ear please would you tell me said al ice a little timid ly for shew as not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first why your ca t gr in s like that its aches h ir ec at said the d uch ess and that s why pi g she said the last word with such sudden violence that al ice quite jumped but she sa win another moment that it was addressed to the baby and not to hers o she took courage and went on again i did nt know that ch eshi r ec a ts always gr inn edi n fact i did nt know that ca ts could gr in they all can said the d uch ess and most o fe md oi don t know of any that do al ice said very polite ly feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation you don t know much said the d uch ess and that sa fact a lic edi d not a tall like the tone of this remark and thought it would b ea swell to introduces o me other subject of conversation while shew as trying to fix o none the cook took the ca u ld ro n of soup off the fire and at once set to work throwing every thing within her reach at the d uch ess and the baby the fire iron s came first then followed a shower o fs a uce pan sp late s and dishes the d uch ess took no notice of them even when they hither and the baby wa show l ing so much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blow s hurt i to r not oh please mind what your e doing cried al ice jumping up and down in an agony of terror oh there goes his precious no seas an un usually large sa uce pan flew close b yi tan d very nearly carried it off if every body minded their own business the d uch ess said in a hoarse grow l the world would go round a deal faster than it does which would not b ea n advantages aid al ice who felt very glad to ge tan opportunity o fs h owing off a little of her knowledge just think of what work it would make with the d aya nd night you see the earth takes twenty four hours to turn round on its a xi s talking of axe s said the d uch es sch op off her head al ice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meant to take the hint but the cook was bu s ily stirring the soup and seemed not to be listening so she went on again twenty four hours i think o ri sit twelve io h don tb other me said the d uch essi never could abide figures and with that she began nur sing her child again singing a sort o fl

ease sch o ru sin which the cook and the baby joined wo w wo w wo w while the d uch ess sang the second verse of the songs he kept to s sing the baby violent ly up and down and the poor little thing how led so that al ice could hardly h earth e words i speaks ever ely tom y boy i beat him when he sn e eze s for he can thoroughly enjoy the p ep per when he pleases ch o ru sw ow wo w wo where you

threw af ryi ng pan after her as she went out but it just missed her al ice caught the baby with some difficulty a sit was a queer shape d little creature and held out its arms and leg sin all directions just li k east ar fish thought al ice the poor little thing was s nor t ing li k east ea men gi ne when she caught i tan d kept do ubl ing itself up and st raight en ing itself out a gains o that altogether forth e first minute or two it was as much as she could do to hold i ta s soon as she had made out the proper way of nur sing it which was to tw is ti tu p into a sort o fk no tan d then keep tight hold o fits right ea ran d left foot so as to prevent it sun doing itself she carried it out into the open a iri fi don t take this child away with me thought al ice they re sure to k

al ice that s not a tall a proper way of expressing yourself the baby g run ted again and al ice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it there could b en o doubt that it had a very turn up no se much more like a sn out than a real no se also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether a lic edi d not like the look of the thing a tall but perhaps it was only so bb ing she thought and looked into its eyes again to see if there were any tears no there were no tears if your e going to turn into a pi g my dears aid al ice seriously ill have nothing more to do with you mind now the poor little things ob bed again o rg run t edi t was impossible to say which and they went on for some while in silence al ice was just beginning to think to herself now what a mi to do with this creature when i get it home when i tg run ted a gains o violent ly that she looked down into its face in some alarm this time there could b en o mistake about i ti t was neither more no rles s than a pi g and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see i tt ro t away quietly into the wood i fit had grown up she said to herself it would have made a dreadfully ugly child but it makes rather a handsome pi gi think and she began thinking over other children she knew who might do very well a sp i gs and was just saying to herself if one only knew the right way to change them when shew a sa little startled by seeing the ch eshi r ec at sitting on abo u gh o fa tree a few yards off the ca t only gr inn ed when its a wa l ice it looked goodnatured she thoughts till i th adver y long c law s and a great many tee th so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect ch eshi r

you tell me please which w ayi ought to go from here that depends a good deal on where you want to get to said the ca ti don t much care wheres aid al ice then it does nt matter which way you go said the ca ts o long a si get somewhere al ice added a sa n explanation oh your e sure to do that said the ca ti f you only walk long enough al ice felt that this could not be denied so she tried another

either you like they re both mad but i don t want to go among mad people al ice remark ed oh you can t help that said the ca t were all mad here imm ad your e mad how do you know imm ad said al ice you must be said the ca to r you would nt have come here a lic edi dn t think that proved i ta tall however she went on and how do you know that your e mad to begin with said the ca ta dog s not mad

therefore imm adi call it pur ring not grow l ing said al ice call it what you likes aid the ca td o you play c ro qu et with the queen to day i should like it very much said al ice but i have nt been

thought it would said the ca tan d vanish ed again al ice waited a little half expecting to see it again but it did not appear and after a minute or two she walked o ninth e direction in which the march h are was said t olive i ve seen hat ters before she said to herself the march h are will be much them o st interesting and perhaps as this is may i two n tb e raving mad at least not so mad a sit wa sin march as she said this she looked up and there was the ca t again sitting on a branch o fa tree did you say pi go r fi g said the ca ti said pi g replied al ice and i wish you would nt keep appearing and vanish ing so suddenly you make one quite giddy all rights aid the ca tan d this time it vanish ed quite slowly beginning with the end of the ta i land ending with the gr in which remained some time after there s to fit had gone w el live often seen a ca t without a gr in thought al ice but a gr in without a ca t its them o st curious thing ie vers a win my life she had not gone much farther before she came insight of the house of the march h are she thought it must b eth e right house because the chimney s were shape d like e ars and t hero of was that ch ed with fu ri t was so large a house that sh edi d not like to go nearer till she had n ib b led some more of the lef than d bit of mu sh room and raised herself to about two feet high event h en she walked up towards it rather timid ly saying to herself suppose it should be raving mad after all i almost wish id gone to see the hat ter instead chapter vii a mad tea party there was a tables et out under a tree in front of the house and the march h are and the hat ter were having tea a ti ta do r mo us ewa s sitting between them fast asleep and the other two were using i ta s acu shi on re sting their elbow son i tan d talking over its he adver y uncomfortable forth ed or mo use thought al ice only a sit s asleep i suppose it does nt mind the table was a large one but the three were all crowded together a tone corner o fit no room no room they cried out when they saw al ice coming there s plenty of rooms aid al ice indignantly and she sat down in a large arm chair a tone end of the table have some wine the march h are said in an encouraging tone al ice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it but tea i don t see any wine she remark ed there i sn tan y said the march h are then it was nt very civil o fy out o offer it said al ice an g rily it was nt very civil o fy out o sit down without being invited said the march h are i did nt know it was your tables aid al ice its laid for a great many more than three your hair wants cutting said the hat ter he had been looking a ta l ice for some time with great curiosity and this was his first speech you should learn not to make personal remarks al ice said with some severity its very rude the hat ter opened his eyes very wi d eo n hearing this bu tall he said was why i sa rave n like a writing desk come we shall have some fu n now thought al ice im glad they ve begun asking riddles i believe i can guess that she added aloud do you meant ha tyo u think you can find out the answer to it said the march h are exactly so said al ice then you should say what you meant he march h are went on i do al ice hastily replied at least at least i mean what i say that s the same thing you known ot the same thing a bit said the hat ter you might just a swell say that i see what i eat is the same thing a si eat what i see you might just a swell say added the march h are that i like what i get is the same thing a si get what i like you might just a swell say added the do r mo use who seemed to be talking in his sleep that i breathe when i sleep is the same thing a si sleep when i breathe i tis the same thing with you said the hat tera nd here the conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute while al ice thought over all she could remember about rave ns and writing desk s which was nt much the hat ter was the first to break the silence what day of the month i sit he said turning to al ice he had taken his watch out of his pocket and was looking a ti tu n easily shaking it every now and then and holding i tt o his ear al ice considered a little and then said the fourth two days wrong sighed the hat ter i told you butter would nt suit the works he added looking an g rily at the march h are it was the best butter the march h are me ek ly replied yes but some cru mb s must have got in a swell the hat ter g rumble d you should nt have put i ti n with the bread knife the march h are took the watch and looked a ti t gloom ily then h edi pp edi t into his cu po f tea and looked a ti t again bu the could think of nothing better to say than his first remark it was the best butter you know al ice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity what afun ny watch she remark edi t tells the day of the month and does nt tell what o clock i tis why should i tm uttered the hat ter does your watch tell you what year i tis of course not al ice replied very readily but that s because it stays the same year for such along time together which is just the case with mine said the hat tera l ice felt dreadfully puzzled the hat ters remarks e em edt o have no sort of meaning in i tan d yet it was certainly english i don t quite understand you she said as polite ly as she could the do r mo use is asleep a gains aid the hat tera n dh e pour ed a little hot tea upon its no set h ed or mo use shook its head im patiently and said without opening its eyes of course of course just what iwa s going to remark myself have you guessed the riddle yet the hat ter said turning to al ice again n oi give i tu pa l ice replied what s the answer i have nt the slightest ideas aid the hat ter nor i said the march ha real ice sighed w ea rily i think you might do something better with the times he said than waste i ti n asking riddles that have no answers if you knew time a swell a sid o said the hat ter you would nt talk about wa sting it its hi mid on t know what you means aid al ice of course you don t the hat ter said to s sing his head contemptuous ly i dares ay you never even spoke to time perhaps not al ice cautiously replied but i know i have to beat time when i learn music ah that accounts for it said the hat ter h ew on t stand b eating now if you only kept on good terms with him h ed do almost anything you liked with the clock for instances up pos ei t were nine o clock in the morning just time to begin lessons you d only have to whisper a hint to ti mean d round goes the clock in a twinkling half pa stone time for dinner i only wish it was the march h are said to itself in a whisper that would be grand certainly said al ice thoughtfully but then i should n tb e hungry for i tyo u known ota t first perhaps said the hat ter bu tyo u could keep i tt o half pa stone as long as you liked is that th ewa y you manage al ice asked the hat ter shook his head mournful ly not ih e replied we quarrelled last march just before he went mad you know pointing with his tea spoon at the march h are i tw a sat the great concert given by the queen of hearts and i had to sing t wink let wink le little bath o wi wonder what your ea tyo u know the song perhaps i ve heard something like it said al ice it goes on you know the hat ter continued in this way up above the world you fly like a tea tray in the sky t wink let wink le here the do r mo use shook itself and began singing in its sleep t wink let wink let wink let wink lea nd went on so long that they had top inch it tom akei t stop well id hardly finished the first verses aid the hat ter when the queen jumped up and bawl ed out h es mu rd e ring the time off with his head how dreadfully s ava ge exclaimed al ice and ever since that the hat ter went on in a mournful tone h ew on td oa thing i ask its always six o clock now a bright idea came into al ice s head is that the reasons o many tea things are put ou there she asked yes that sit said the hat ter with a sigh its always tea ti mean dw even o time to was h the things between while s then you keep mo vi n ground i supposes aid al ice exactly so said the hat tera s the things get used up but what happens when you come to the beginning again al ice ventured to ask suppose we change the subject the march h are interrupted ya wn ing im getting tired of this i vo t eth e young lady tells u sa story im afraid i don t know ones aid al ice rather alarmed at the proposal then the do r mo use shall they both cried w ake up do r mo u sea nd they p inch edi to n both side sat once the do r mo use slowly opened his eyes iwa sn t asleep he said in a hoarse feeble voice i heard every word you fellows were saying tell u sa story said the march ha r eyes pleased o plea d ed al ice and be quick about it added the hat ter o ry oul lb e asleep again before its done once upon a time there were three little sisters the do r mo use began in a great hurry and their names were els ie la cie and till ie and they lived at the bottom o fa well what did they live on said al ice who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking they lived on tr e acl e said the do r mo use after thinking a minute or two they could nt have done that you know al ice gently remark ed they d have been ill so they were said the do r mo us every ill al ice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like but it puzzled her too much so she went on but why did they live at the bottom o fa well takes o me more tea the march h are said to a lic every earnestly i ve had nothing yet al ice replied in an offended tones oi can t take more you mean you can t take less said the hat ter its very easy to take more than nothing nobody asked your opinions aid al ice who s making personal remarks now the hat ter asked triumphantly a lic edi d not quite know what to say to this so she helped herself to some tea and bread and butter and then turned to the do r mo u sea nd repeated her question why did they live at the bottom o fa well the do r mo use again took a minute or two to think about i tan d then said i tw a sat re acl e well there sn o such thing al ice was beginning very an g rily but the hat tera nd the march h are went sh shan d the do r mo use su lk ily remark edi f you can tb e civil you d better finish the story for yourself no please go on al ice said very hum b ly i wo n ti n ter ru pt again i dares ay there may be one one indeed said the do r mo use indignantly however he consented to go on and so these three little sisters they were learn ing to draw you know what did they draws aid al ice quite forgetting her promise tr e acl e said the do r mo use without considering a tall this time i want a clean cu p interrupted the hat ter lets all move one place on he moved o nash e spoke and the do r mo use followed him the march ha removed into the do r mo use s place and al ice rather un willingly took the place of the march h are the hat ter was the only o new ho go tan y advantage from the change and al ice was a good deal worse off than before as the march h are had just up set the milk ju g into his p late a lic edi d not wish to offend the do r mo u sea gains o she began very cautiously but i don t understand where did they draw the tr e acl e from you can draw water out o fa water well said the hat ters oi should think you could draw tr e acl e out o fat re acl e well eh stupid but they were in the well al ice said to the do r mo use notch oo sing to notice this last remark of course they were said the do r mo use well in this answers o confused poor al ice that she let the do r mo use go on for some time without interrupting it they were learn ing to draw the do

ha real ice was silent the do r mo use had closed its eyes by this ti mean d was going off into a do z ebu to n being p inch ed by the hat ter i two k eu p again with a little shr i eka nd went on that begins wi than m such as mo u set ra ps and them oo n and memory and much ness you know you say things are much o fa much ness did you e verse e such a thing a sa drawing o fa much ness really now you ask me said a lic every much confused i don t think then you should nt talks aid the hat ter this piece of rudeness was more than al ice could bears he got u pi n great disgust and walked off the do r mo use fell asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going though she looked back once or twice half hoping that they would call after her the last times he saw them they were trying to put the do r mo use into the tea p ota tan y rate ill never go there a gains aid al ice as she pick ed her way through the wood its the stupidest tea party i ever wa satin all my life just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it that s very curious she thought but every things curious to day i think im aya swell go in at once and in she went once more she found herself in the long hall and closet o the little gl as stable no will manage better this times he said to herself and began by taking the little gold en key and un lock ing the door that le dint o the g ardent h en she went to work n ib bl ing at them u sh rooms he had kept apiece o fit in her pocket till shew as about a foot high then she walked down the little passage and then she found herself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright flower beds and the cool fo un ta in s chapter viii the queen sc ro qu et ground a larger o se tree stood n earth e entrance of the g ardent hero se s growing on it were white but there were three gardeners a ti tb us ily pain t ing them red al ice thought this a very curious thing and she went nearer to watch them and just as she came up to t hems he heard one o ft hems ay look out now five don t go sp la shi ng pain t over me like that i could nt help it said five in a su lk y tone seven jo gg ed my elbow on which seven looked up and said that s right five always lay the blame on others you d better not talks aid five i heard the queen say only yesterday you deserved to b eb e headed what for said the o

his bru shan d had just beg unwell o fall the unjust things when his eye chance d to fall upon al ice as she stood watching them and he checked himself suddenly the others looked round also and all of them bowed low would you tell me said al ice a little timid ly why you are pain t ing those rose s five and seven said nothing but looked at two two began in a low voice why the fact is you see miss this here ought to have been a red rose tree and we put a white one in by mistake and if the queen was to find it out we should all have our head s cut off you knows o you see miss were doing our best a fore she comes to at this moment five who had been anxiously looking across the garden called out the queen the queen and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves fl at upon their faces there was a sound of many footsteps and al ice looked round eager to see the queen first came tens ol die rs carrying club s these were all shape d like the three gardeners ob long and fl at with their hands and feet at the corner s next the ten court i ers these were ornamented al lover with di a mo n ds and walked two and two as the sold i ers did after these came t hero ya l children there were ten of them and the little dears came jumping me r rily along hand in hand in couple s they were all ornamented with hearts next came the guests mostly kings and queen s and among them al ice re cogni

a crim son velvet cu shi on and last o fall this grand process io n came the king and queen of hearts al ice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at process io ns and besides what would b eth e use o fa process io n thoughts h ei f people had all to lie down upon their faces so that they could nt see its o she stood still wheres h ewa s and waited when the process io n came opposite to al ice they all stopped and looked a the ran d the queen said severe ly who is this she said i

your ma j es ty said a lic every polite ly but she added to herself why they re only a pack of cards after all i need n tb e afraid of them and who are these said the queen pointing to the three gardeners who were ly in ground t hero se tree for you see as they were ly ing on their faces and the pattern on their back s was the same as there s to f the packs he could not tell whether they were gardeners or sold i ers or court i ers or three of hero wn children how should i knows aid al ice surprise da t hero wn courage its no business of mine the queen turned crim son with fu rya nd after

and then turning t other o se trees he went on what have you been doing here may it please your ma j es ty said two in a very humble tone going down o none knee a she spoke we were trying i sees aid the queen who had meanwhile been examining t hero se s off with their head s and the process io n moved on three of the sold i ers remaining behind to exe cut eth e unfortunate gardeners who ran to al

wondering very much what would happen next it sit sa very fine days aid a timid voice at hers i de shew as walking by the white r abb i tw how a sp ee p ing anxiously into her fa c every said al ice wheres the d uch ess hush hush said the r abb i ti na low hurried tone he looked anxiously over his shoulder a she spoke and then raised himself upon ti p to ep u this mouth closet o here a ran d whispered she s under sentence of execution what for said a lic edi d you say what a pity the r abb it asked n oi did nt said al ice i don t think its a tall a pity i said what for she box edt he queen se ars the r abb it began al ice gave a little scream of laugh ter oh hush the r abb it whispered in a frightened tone the queen will hear you you sees he came rather late and the queen said get to your places sh out edt he queen in a voice of th under and people began running about in all directions tu mbl ing up against each other however they got settled down in a minute or two and the game began al ice thoughts he had never seen such a curious c ro qu et ground in her life it was all rid ge s and fu r rows the balls were live hedge ho gs them al lets live fl a mi n goes and the sold i ers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet to make the arch es the chief difficulty al ice found at first wa sin man ag ing her fl am ing o she succeeded in getting its body tu cked away comfortably enough under her arm with its leg s hanging down but generally just as she had got its neck nicely st raight en ed ou tan d was going to give the hedge ho ga blow with its head it would tw i st itself round and look u pi n her face with such a puzzled expression that she could not help burst in gout laughing and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again it was very provoking to find that the hedge ho gh a dun roll ed itself and wa sin the act o fc ra wl ing away besides all this there was generally a rid ge or fu r row in th ewa y wherever she wanted to send the hedge h og to and as the doubled up sold i ers were always getting up and walking off tooth er parts of the ground al ice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed the players all played at once without waiting for turns quarrelling all the while and fight ing forth e hedge ho gs and in a very short time the queen wa sin a fu rio us passion and went s ta mp ing about and sh out ing off with his head or off with her head about once in a minute al ice began to feel very uneasy to be sure she had not a sy eth ad any di s put e with the queen but she knew that it might happen any minute and then thoughts he what would become of me they re dreadfully fond o fb e head ing people here the great wonder is that there s any one left a lives h ewa s looking about for some way of escape and wondering whether she could get away without beings e en when she noticed a curious appearance in the a iri t puzzled her very much at first but after watching i ta minute or two she made it out to b ea gr in and she said to herself its the ch eshi r ec at now i shall have somebody total k to ho ware you getting on said the ca ta s soon as there was mouth enough for i tt o speak with al ice waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded its no use speaking to its he thought till its e ars have come o ra t lea stone of them in another minute the whole head appeared and then al ice put down her fl am ing o and began an account of the game feeling very glad she had some one to listen to her the ca t seemed to think that there was enough o fit now insight and no more o fit appeared i don t think they play a tall fairly al ice began in rather a complain ing tone and they all quarrels o dreadfully one can t hear oneself speak and they don t seem to have any rules in particular at least if there are nobody attends to them and you v en o idea how co nf using i tis all the things being alive for instance there s the arch i ve got to go through next walking about at the o there n do f the ground and i should have c ro qu et edt he queen s hedge h og just now only it ran away when its aw mine coming how do you like the queen said the ca ti na low voice not a tall said al ice she ss o extremely just then she noticed that the queen was close behind her listening so she went on likely to win that its hardly worth while finishing the game the queen smiled and passed on who are you talking to said the king going up to al ice and looking at the ca ts head with great curiosity its a friend of mine aches h ir ec at said al ice allow met o introduce i ti don t like the look o fit a tall said the king however it may ki ss my hand i fit likes id rather not the ca t remark ed don tb e impertinent said the king and don t look a tm e like that he got behind al ice a she spoke a ca t may look a taking said al ice i ve read that in some book but i don t remember where well it must be removed said the king very decidedly and he called the queen w how as passing at the moment my dear i wish you would have this ca t removed the queen had only o new a yo f settling all difficulties great or small off with his head she said without even looking round ill fetch the execution er myself said the king eagerly and he hurried off al ice thoughts he might a swell go back and see how the game was going on as she heard the queen s voice in the distance scream ing with passion she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be exe cu ted for having missed their turns and sh edi d not like the look of things a tall as the game wa sins uch confusion that she never knew whether i tw a she r turn or not so she went in se arch of her hedge h og the hedge h og was engaged in a fight with another hedge h og which seemed to al ice an excellent opportunity for c ro qu e ti n gone of them with the other the only difficulty was that her fl am ing o was gone across to the others id eo f the garden where al ice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree by the times he had caught the fl am ing o and brought it back the fight was over and both the hedge ho gs were out of sight but it does nt matter much thought al ice as all the arch e sar e gone from this side of the grounds o she tu cked it away under her arm that it might not escape again and went back for a little more conversation with her friend when she got back to the ch eshi r ec at shew as surprise d to find quite a large crowd collected round it there wa sad is put e going on between the execution er the king and the queen who were all talking at once while all there st were quite silent and looked very uncomfortable them o mental ice appeared shew as appealed to by all three to settle the question and they repeated their arguments to her though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said the execution ers argument was that you could nt cut off ahead unless there was a body to cut it off from that he had never had to do such a thing before and h ewa sn t going to begin a this time of life the kings argument was that anything that had ahead could b eb e headed and that you were nt total k nonsense the queen s argument was that if something was nt don eabou ti ti n less than no times h ed have every body exe cu ted all round it was this last remark that had made the whole party looks o grave and anxious al ice could think of nothing else to say but it belongs to the d uch ess you d better ask her about its he sin pri son the queen said to the execution er fetch her here and the execution er went off like a narrow the ca ts head began f adi ng away the moment h ewa s gone and by the time he had come back with the d uch essi t had entirely di s appeared so the king and the execution er ran wild ly up and down looking for it while there s to f the party went back to the game chapter ix them o ck tu rt les story you can t think how glad ia m to see you again you dear old things aid the d uch ess as she tu cked her arm affectionately into al ice s and they walked off together al ice was very glad to find h eri n such a pleasant temper and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the p ep pert hat had made hers os ava ge when they met in the kitchen when i mad uch ess she said to herself not in a very hope ful tone though i wo nt have any p ep p eri n my kitchen a tall soup does very well without may be its always p ep pert hat makes people hot tempered she went on very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule and vi ne gar that makes them sour and ca mo mile that makes them bitter and and ba rle y su ga ran d such things that make children sweet tempered i only wish people knew that then they would n tb e so sting y about i tyo u knows he had quite forgotten the d uch ess by this ti mean d was a little startled when she heard her voice closet o here ar your e thinking about something my dear and that makes you forget total ki can t tell you just now what the moral of that is but i shall remember i ti na bit perhaps it has n tone al ice ventured to remark tu tt ut child said the d uch ess every things got a moral if only you can find i tan d she sq ue eze d herself up closer to al ice ss ideas she spoke a lic edi d not much like keeping so closet o her first because the d uch ess was very ugly and secondly because shew as exactly the right height to rest h erc h in upon al ice s shoulder and it was an un comfortably sharp ch in however sh edi d not like to be rude so she bore i ta swell as she could the games going on rather better now she said by way of keeping up the conversation a little tis so said the d uch ess and the moral of that i so h tis love tis love that makes the world go round somebody said al ice whispered that its done by every body mind ing their own business ah well it means much the same things aid the d uch essd i gg ing her sharp little ch in into al ice s shoulder as she added and the moral of that i stake care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves how fond she i so f finding moral sin things al ice thought to herself i dares ay your e wondering why i don t put my arm round your wa i st the d uch ess said after a pause the reason is that im doubtful about the temper of your fl am ing o shall i try the ex p eri men the might bi tea l ice cautiously replied not feeling a tall anxious to have the ex p eri men t tried very true said the d uch ess fl a mi n goes and must ard both bi tea nd the moral of that is bird sofa fe a the r flock together only must ard i sn ta bird al ice remark ed right as usual said the d uch ess what a clear way you have of putting things its a mine ra li thinks aid al ice of course i tis said the d uch ess who seemed ready to agree to every thing that al ice said there sa large must ard mine near here and the moral of that is the more there i so f mine the less there i so f yours oh i know exclaimed al ice who had not attended to this last remark it save ge table it does nt look like one but i tis i quite agree with you said the d uch ess and the moral of that i sb e what you would seem to b eo ri f you d like it put more simply never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise i think i should understand that better al ice said very polite ly i fi h adi t written down but i can t quite follow i ta s you say it that s nothing to what i could say i fi chose the d uch ess replied in a pleased tone pray don t trouble yourself to say i tan y longer than that said al ice oh don t talk about troubles aid the d uch essi make you a present of every thing i ve said as yet a cheap sort of present thought al ice im glad they don t give birthday presents like that but sh edi d not venture to say it out loud thinking again the d uch ess asked with another dig of her sharp little ch in i ve aright to thinks aid al ice sharp ly for shew as beginning to feel a little wo rr ied just about as much rights aid the d uch ess a sp i gs have to fly and them bu there to al ice s great surprise the d uch ess s voice died away eve ninth e middle of her favourite word moral and t hear m that was li n ke dint o hers began to tremble al ice looked up and there stood the queen in front of them with her arms folded fr owning like a th under storm a fine day your ma j es ty the d uch ess began in a low weak voice now i give you fair war n ing sh out edt he queen s ta mp ing on the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off and that in about half no time take your choice the d uch ess took her choice and was gone in a moment lets go on with the game the queen said to al ice and al ice was too much frightened to s aya word but slowly followed her back to the c ro qu et ground the other guests had taken advantage of the queen s absence and were re sting in the shade however the moment they saw her they hurried back to the game the queen merely re marking that a moments delay would cost them their lives all the time they were playing the queen never left off quarrelling with the other players and sh out ing off with his head or off with her head those whom she sentence d were taken into cu s to d yb y the sold i ers who of course had to leave off being arch es to do this so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arch es left and all the players except the king the queen and al ice were in cu s to dy and under sentence of execution then the queen left off quite out of breath and said to al ice have you seen them o ck tu rt ley e tn o said al ice i don t even know what a mock tu r tl ei sit s the thing mock tu r tl e soup is made from said the queen i never saw one or heard of ones aid al ice come on then said the queen and he shall tell you his history as they walked off together al ice heard the kings ayi na low voice to the company generally you a real l pardoned come that sa good things he said to herself for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of execution s the queen had ordered they very soon came upon a gr yp h only ing fast asleep in the sun if you don t know what a gr yp h on is look at the picture up lazy things aid the queen and take this young lady to see them o ck tu rt lea nd to hear his history i must go back and see after some execution si have ordered and she walked off leaving al ice alone with the gr yp h on a lic edi d not quite like the look of the creature but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with i ta s to go after that s ava ge queen so she waited the gr yp h on sat up and rub b edi ts eyes then it watched the queen till shew as out of sight then i tc hu ck led what f unsaid the gr yp h on half to itself half to al ice what is the f unsaid al ice why she said the gr yp h on its all her fancy
