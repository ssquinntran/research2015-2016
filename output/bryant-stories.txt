ho le in the ground he sl ipp ed through and saw some stairs going down into the earth the a corn was roll ing down with a soft tapp ing sound ahead of him so down he went too down down down roll edt h ea corn and down down down went the field mo us eun ti l suddenly he saw a ti ny door at the foot of the stairs th eshi n ya corn roll edt o the door and struck against i tw i that ap quickly the little door opened and the a corn roll edi n side the field mo use hurried as fast a she could down the last stairs and pushed through just as the door was closing it shut behind hi man dh ewa sin a

it happened that i did not read it for myself or hear it again during my childhood one christmas day when iwa s grown u pi found myself a ta loss forth e one more story called for by some little children with whom iwa s spending the holiday in the mental se arch for buried treasure which ensued i came u po none or two word impression soft he experience soft he little fir tree and forth with wo ve them into what i supposed to be something o fare pro ductio n of the original the latter part of the story had wholly fa d ed from my memory so that i made up to suit the taste so f my au die nce after w ard i told the story to a good many children a tone time or another and it gradually took the shape it has here it was not un ti l several years later that in re reading and ers en for other purposes i came upon there al story of the little fir tree an dread it for myself then indeed iwa s amused and somewhat distressed to find how far i had wander ed from the t ext i give this explanation that there ad er may know i do not presume to offer the little ta le which follows a sa n adapt a ti on of and ers en s famous story i offer it plainly a sa story which children have liked and which grew out of my early me mo ri e sofa nd ers en s little f iron ce there was a little fir trees li man d pointed and shi ny which stood in the great forest in the midst of some b ig fir trees broad and tall and shadow y green the little fir tree was very unhappy because h ewa s not b ig like the others when the bird s came flying into the woods and li to n the branch e soft h eb ig trees and built their nes ts there he used to call up to them come down come down rest in my branch es but they always said oh non o you are too little when the s ple n did wind came bl owing and singing through the forest it bent and ro cked and sw un g the top soft h eb ig trees and murmured to them then the little fir tree looked up and called oh pleased ear wind come down and play with m ebu the always said oh no you are too little you are too little in the winter the white snow fell softly softly and covered the great trees al lover with wonderful caps and co a ts of white the little fir tree closed ow ninth ec over of the others would call u po h pleased ear snow give me acap too i want to play too but the snow always said oh non on o you are too little you are too little the worst o fall was when men came into the wood with s led ge s and tea ms of horses they came to cut the b ig trees down and carry them away whenever one had been cut down and carried away the others talked about i tan d nodded their head s and the little fir tree listened and heard t hems ay that when you were carried a ways o you might become them as to fa mighty ship and go far away over the o cea n and seem any wonderful things or you might be part o fa fine house in a great ci ty and seem uch of life the little fir tree wanted greatly to see life but h ewa s always too little them en passed him by but by and by one cold winter s morning men came with as led ge and horses and after they had cu there and there they came to the circle of trees round the little fir tree and looked all about there are none little e nought h ey said oh how the little fir tree pri cked up his need les here is ones ai done of them en i tis just little enough and he touched the little fir tree the little fir tree was happy a sa bird because he knew they w er eabou tt o cut him down and when h ewa s being carried away on the s led ge he lay wondering contented ly whether he should be them as to fa ship or part o fa fine ci ty house but when they came to the town h ewa s taken ou tan d set upright in a tu band placed on the ed ge o fa pa thin a row of other fir trees all small but none so little a she and then the little fir tree began to see life people kept coming to look at the trees and to take them away but always when they saw the little fir tree they shook their head s and said i tis too little too little un ti l final ly two children came along hand in hand looking carefully a tall the small trees when they saw the little fir tree they cried out well take this one i tis just little e nought h ey took him out of his tu band carried him away between them and the happy little fir trees pen tall his time wondering what it could be that h ewa s just little enough for he knew it could hardly beam as to ra houses i nce h ewa s going away with children he kept wondering while they took him in through some b ig doors and set him u pi n another tu bo n the table in a bare little room very soon they went away and came back again with ab ig basket which they carried between them then some pretty ladies with white caps on their head s and white apro ns over their blue dress es came bringing little parcels the children took things out of the basket and began to play with the little fir tree just a she had often begged the wind and the snow and the bird s to do he felt theirs o ft little touches on his head and his tw i gs and his branch es when he looked down at himself as far a she could look he saw that h ewa s all hung with gold and silver ch a in s there were string so f white fl uff y st uff d ro op ing around him his tw i gs held little gold nut s and pink ro sy balls and silver stars he had pretty little pink and white candles in his arms but la stand most wonderful o fall the children hung a beautiful white fl oa t ing do l la n ge lover his head the little fir tree could not breathe for joy and wonder what wa sit that h ewa snow why was this glory for him after a time every one went away and left him it grew dusk and the little fir tree began to hear strange sounds through the closed doors sometimes he heard a child c ryi n gh ewa s beginning to be lonely it grew more and more shadow y all at once the doors opened and the two children came in two of the pretty ladies were with them they came up to the little fir tree and quickly lighted all the little pink and white candles then the two pretty ladies took hold of the table with the little fir tree on i tan d pushed it very smooth ly and quickly out of the doors across a hall and in at another door the little fir tree had a sudden sight of along room with many little white beds in i to f children prop ped upon p ill ow sin the beds and of other children in great wh ee led chair s and others ho bb l ing about or sitting in little chair she wondered why all the little children looked so white and tired h edi d not know that h ewa sin a ho sp i ta l but before he could wonder any more his breath was quite taken away by the sh out those little white children gave oh oh mm mm they cried how pretty how beautiful o his n ti t lovely he knew they must mean him for all theirs h in ing eyes were looking st raight at him he stood a ss t raight a sa ma stand qui ver edi n every need lef or joy presently one little weak child voice called out its then ice st christmas tree ie vers a wan d then at last the little fir tree knew what h ewa shew a sa christmas tree and from his shi ny head to his feet h ewa s glad through and through because h ewa s just little e nought o be then ice st kind of tree in the world how mo se s was saved thousands of years ago many years before da vi d lived there was a very wise and good man of his people w how a sa friend and adviser of the king of egypt and for love of this friend the king of egypt had let numbers of the i sr ae li tes settle in his land but after the king and his i sr ae li tis h friend were dead there was a new king who hated the i sr ae li tes when he saw how strong they were and how many there were of them he began to be afraid that some day they might number more than the egypt ia ns and might take his land from him then he and his rule rs did a wicked thing they made the i sr ae li tes slave s and they gave them ter r ible t asks to do without proper rest or food or clothes forth ey hoped that the hardship would k ill off the i sr ae li tes they thought the old men would die and the young men b es oil land weary that they could not bring up families and s other a ce would d wind le away but in spite of the work and suffering the i sr ae li tes remained strong and more and more boys grew up to make the king afraid then h edi d them o st wicked thing o fall he ordered his sold i ers to k ill every boy baby that should be born in an i sr ae li tis h family h edi d not car eabou t the girls because they could not grow up to fight very soon after this wicked order abo y baby was born in a certain i sr ae li tis h family when his mother first looked at him her heart was nearly broken for h ewa seven more beautiful than most ba b ie sar e so strong and fair and sweet but h ewa s abo y how could she save him from death somehow she contrived to keep him hid d en forth r ee whole months but at the end of that times he saw that it would not be possible to keep him safe any longer she had been thinking all this ti m eabou t what she should do and now she carried out her plan first she took a basket made o fb ul rush es and da ub edi ta l lover with pitch so that it was water tight and then she laid the baby in it then she carried i tt o the ed ge of the river and laid i ti n the fl a gs by the river sb ri n ki t did not show a tall unless one were quite near it then she kissed her little son and left him there bu this sisters t ood far off not seeming to watch but really watching carefully to see what would happen to the baby soon there was the sound of talk and laugh tera nda train of beautiful women came down to the waters ed ge it was the kings daughter come down to bath ei n the river with her maid en s the maid en s walked along by the river s ideas the kings daughter came near to the waters he saw the strange little basket ly ing in the fl a gs and she sent her maid to bring i tt oh e ran d when she had opened its he saw the child the poor baby was c ryi ng when she sa whims o helpless and so beautiful c ryi ng for his mother the kings daughter pitied hi man d loved him she knew the cruel order of her father and she said at once this is one of the h eb r ews children at that moment the baby s sister came to the prince ss and said shall i go and find the ea nurse from the h eb r ew women so that she may nurse the child forth ee not a word did she say about whose child it was but perhaps the prince ss guessed i don t know a tall events she told the little girl to go so the maid en went and brought her mother then the kings daughters aid to the baby s mother take this child away and nurse it for mean di will give the ew ages was not that a strange thing and can you think how happy the baby s mother was for now the baby would be known only as the prince ss s adopt ed child and would be safe and it was so the mother kept him un ti lh ewa sold e nought o be taken to the prince ss spa lace then h ewa s brought and given to the kings daughter and he became hers on and she named h imm o se s but the strangest part of the whole story is that when mo se s grew to beam an he became so strong and wise that i tw a shew h oa t last saved his people from the king and rescue d them from the egypt ia ns the one child saved by the kings own daughter was th every one the king would most have wanted to k ill i fh e had known the ten fair ies once upon

a blue j ew e la t the foot of the western hill s was a ma r vel lou sl ake of salt water an in lands ea so the pi one ers settled there and built themselves hut s and ca b in s forth e first winter it had taken them many months to make the ter r ible journey many had died of weariness and illness on th ewa y many died of hardship during the winter and the provision s they had brought in their wag on s were so nearly gone that by spring they were living partly on root sd ug from the ground all their lives now depended on the c ro p so b rain and ve ge tables which they could raise in the v all ey they made the bar r en land fer t ile by spreading water from the little stream s over it what we call i rr i ga t ing and they plan ted enough corn and g rain and ve ge tables for all the people every one helped and every one watched forth e sp rout ing with hopes and pray ers and careful eye sing ood time these ed ss p route d and the dry brown earth was covered with a carpet of tender green growing things no farmer s garden could have looked better than the great garden of the desert v all ey and from day to day the little shoot s grew and fl our i she d till they were all well above the ground then a ter r ible thing happened one day them en who were watering the c ro ps saw a great number of cri c kets s warm ing over the ground at the ed ge of the gardens nearest the mount a in s they were hop p ing from the bar r en places into the young green c ro ps and as they settled down they ate the ti ny shoot s and leaves to the ground more ca mean d more and ever more

none place ne warm ies of cri c kets march ed down the mount a in side s and attacked the fields in other places and at last the people fell on their knee s and wept and cried in despair forth ey saw

the people were knee l ing on the de so late fields pray ing for deliver a nce from the plague of cri c kets suddenly from far off in the air to w ard the great salt l ake there was the sound off la

time ago as long ago as when there were fair ies there lived an e mp ero r inch in a who had a most beautiful pa lace all made o fc rys ta l out side the pa lace was the love lies t garden in the whole world and farther away was a forest where the trees were taller than any other trees in the world and farther away still was a deep wood and in this wood lived a little night ing a let he night ing a le sang so beautifully that every body who heard her remembered her song better than anything else that he heard or saw people came from al lover the world to see the c rys ta lp a lace and the wonderful garden and the great forest but when they went ho mean d wrote books about these things they always wrote but the night ing a le is the best o fall at last it happened that the e mp ero r came upon a book which said this and heat once sent for his chamber lain who is this night ing a le said the e mp ero r why have i never heard him sing the chamber lain w how a sa very important persons aid there cannot be any such person i have never heard his name the books ays there i sa night ing a le said the e mp ero ri command that the night ing a le be brought here to sing form e this evening the chamber lain went ou tan d asked all the great lords and ladies and pages where the night ing a le could be found but no tone of them had ever heard of him so the chamber lain went back to the e mp ero ran d said there i sn o such person the books ays there i sa night ing a le said the e mp ero ri f the night ing a le i sn o there to sing form e this evening i will have the court tr ample d upon immediately after supper the chamber lain did not want to be tr ample d upon so he ran ou tan d asked every body in the pa la c eabou t the night ing a lea t last a little girl who worked in the kitchen to help the cook said oh yes i know the night ing al every well every night when i got o carry sc ra ps from the kitchen tom y mother who lives in the wood beyond the forest ih earth e night ing a le sing the chamber lain asked the maid to take him to the night ing a les ho mean d many of the lords and ladies followed after when they had gone a little way they heard a cow mo oa h said the lords and ladies that must b eth e night ing a le what a large voice for so small a creature oh no said the little girl that is just a cow mo o ing a little farther on they heard some bu ll fro g sin a sw a mp surely that is the night ing a le said the court i ers it really sounds like church bell so hn o said the little girl those ar ebu ll fro gs c ro a king at last they came to the wood where the night ing al ewa s hush said the little girls h ei s going to sing and sure e nought he little night ing a le began to sing she sang so beautifully that you have never in all your life heard anything like it dear dears aid the court i ers that is very pleasant does that little grey bird really make all that noise she i ss o pale that i thinks he has lost her colour for fear o fu s the chamber lain asked the little night ing a let oco mean d sing forth ee mp ero r the little night ing a les aids he could sing better in hero wn green wood but shew a ss o sweet and kind that she came with them that evening the pa lace was all trimmed with them o st beautiful flowers you can imagine and rows and rows of little silver bell s that ti nk led when the wind b le win and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of wax candles that sh one like ti ny stars in the great hall there was a gold p erc h forth e night ing a le be side the e mp ero rs thro ne when all the people were there the e mp ero r asked the night ing a let o sing then the little grey night ing a le filled her throat ful lands an g and my dears she sang so beautifully that the e mp ero rs eyes filled up with tears and you know e mp ero r sd o not c rya tall easily so he asked her to sing again and this times he sang so ma r vel lou sly that the tears came out of his eyes and ran down his cheeks that was a great success they asked the little night ing a let o sing over and over again and when they had listened e nought h ee mp ero r said that she should be made sing eri n chief to the courts h ewa s to have a gold en p erc hn earth ee mp ero rs bed and a little gold en c age and was to be allowed to go out twice everyday but there were twelve servants appointed to wait on he ran d those twelve servants went with her every times he went ou tan d each of the twelve had hold of the end o fa silk en string which was tied to the little night ing a les leg it was not so very much fu n to go out that way for along long time the night ing a le sang every evening to the e mp ero ran d his court and they liked hers o much that the ladies all tried to sing like her they used to put water in their mouth s and then make little sounds like this gl u and when the court i ers me teach other in the hall s one would say night and the other would saying a lea nd that was supposed to be conversation a tl a stone day there came a little pack a get o the e mp ero ro n the out side of which was written the night ing a le in side was an artificial bird something like a night ing a le only it was made of gold and silver and rub ies and e me ra ld s and di a mo n ds when it was wound u pi t played a waltz tune and a sit played it moved its little t ail up and down every body in the court was filled with delight at the music of then ew night ing a le they made it sing that same tune thirty three times and still they had not had e nought h ey would have made it sing the tune thirty four times but the e mp ero r said i should like to h earth e real night ing a le sing now but when they looked about forth e real little night ing a le they could not find her anywhere she had taken the chance while every body was listening to the waltz tune s to fly away through the window to hero wn green wood what a very ungrateful bird said the lords and ladies but it does not matter then ew night ing a le is just as good so the artificial night ing al ewa s given there al night ing a les little gold p erc hand every night the e mp ero r wound her up and she sang waltz tune s to him the people in the court liked her even better than the old night ing a le because they could all whist le her tune s which you can td o with real night ing a les about a year after the artificial night ing a le came the e mp ero r was listening to her waltz tune when there was a and ri n side the bird and the music stopped the e mp ero r ran to his d oct o rb u the could not do anything then he ran to his clock make rb u the could not do much nobody could do much the best they could do was to patch the gold night ing a le up so that it could sing once a year event hat was almost too much and the tune was very sh a ky still the e mp ero r kept the gold night ing a le on the p erc h in his own room along time went by and then at last the e mp ero r grew very il land was about to die when i tw assure that he could not live much longer the people chose a new e mp ero ran d waited forth eo l done to diet he poor e mp ero r lay quite cold and pale in his great b ig bed with velvet curtains and tall candles ti cks all about h ewa s quite alone for all the court i ers had gone to congratulate then ew e mp ero randall the servants had gone total ki t over when the e mp ero rw ok eu ph e felt a ter

every very ugly and some were sweet and lovely they were all the things the e mp ero r had done in his life good and bad and a she looked at them they began to whisper they whispered you remember this you remember that the e mp ero r remembered so much that he cried out loud oh bring the great d ru m make music so that i may not h earth e se dreadful whispers but there was nobody there to bring the d ru m then the e mp ero r cried you little gold night ing a le can you not sing something form ei have given you gifts of gold and jewels and kept you always by my side will you not help men ow but there was nobody to wind the little gold night ing a le up and of course it could not sing the e mp ero rs heart grew colder and colder where death c ro uch ed upon i tan d the dreadful whispers grew louder and louder and the e mp ero rs life was almost gone suddenly through the open window there came a most lovely song it was so sweet and so loud that the whispers died quite away presently the e mp ero r fel this heart grow warmth en he felt the blood flow through his limb s again he listened to the song un ti l the tears ran down his cheeks he knew that it was the little real night ing a le who had flown away from him when the gold night ing a le came death was listening to the song too and when it was done and the e mp ero r begged for more death too said pleases ing again little night ing a le will you give met h ee mp ero rs gold crown for a songs aid the little night ing al eyes said death and the little night ing a le bought the e mp ero rs crown for a song oh sing again little

think of his garden in the church yard where he always liked best to be and hero se from the e mp ero rs heart and floated away through the window when death was gone the e mp ero r said to the little night ing a le oh dear little night ing a ley ou have saved me from death do not leave me against ay with me on this little gold p erc hands ing tom e always no dear e mp ero r said the little night ing a le i sing best when ia m free i cannot live in a pa lace but every night when you are quite alone i will co mean d sit in the window and sing to you and tell you every thing that goes on in your

you have a little bird who tells you every thing after the little night ing a le had flown away the e mp ero r felt so well and strong that he dressed himself in his ro ya l robe s and took his gold

and it did seem a si f morning was along way off did you think you could plan t them in the morning asked her mother you know d earth e ground has to be made ready first it takes a little time it may be several days before you can plan t that was another surprise ma r ger y had thoughts he could begin to so w these ed right off but this was what had happened early the next morning a man came driving up to the cottage with two strong white horses in his wag on was a plough i suppose you have seen plough s but ma r ger y never had and she watched with great interest while them an and her

what had that do with the kind of plough what does he mean fathers he whispered when she got a chance he means that this land has not been plough ed before it will be hard to turn the s oil an done horse could not pu ll the plough said her father it took them an two hours to plough the little st rip of land he drove the sharp end of the plough into the so i land held it firmly so while the horses drew it along in a st raight line ma r ger y found i tf a sc in at ing to watch the long line of dark earth and green gr a ss come roll ing up and turn over as the knife passed its he could see that it took real skill and strength to keep the line even and to avoid the stone s sometimes the plough struck a hid d en stone and then them an was j er k ed almost off his feet bu the only laughed and said to u gh piece of land it will b ea lot better next year when he had plough ed them an went back to his cart and un l oad ed another farm imp le men t this o new as like a three corner ed p la

the work in the late afternoon s when he came home from business they could not afford too much help he said and he had learned to take care o fa garden when h ewa sa boys o ma r ger y did not see any more done un ti l the next day but the next day there was hard work form ar ge rys father every bit of that ground had to be broken up still more with a spa de and then the clo ds which were full of gr a ss root s had to be taken on afo rk and shaken till the earth fell out when the gr a ss was thrown to ones i de that would not have had to be done if the land had been plough e dint he autumn the

the garden began to look a garden but best o fall was the work next day when hero wn little particular garden was begun father brown loved ma r ge rya nd ma r ge rys m others o much that he wanted their g ardent o be perfect and that meant a great deal more work he knew very well that the old gr a ss would begin to come through again on such so i land that it would make terribly hard we edi n

sweet p ea s which would grow tall like a screen on the two side s for a kind of hedge were yellow sun flowers and along the front ed ge were the gay n as tu r ti u ms ma r ger y planned that so that

between the flowers and the middle path went these ed s forth at wonderful sa la d garden all the things mrs brown had named tom ar ger y were there ma r ger y had never seen anything more wonderful than the little round let tu ces ee ds they were so ti ny that it did not seem possible that green let t uce leaves could come from them but they surely would mother and father and ma r ger yw e relate to supper that evening but they were all so happy that it did not matter the last thing ma r ger y thought o fa s she went to sleep at night was the dear smooth little garden with its fu nn y

to dream land the little co tyle don s this is another story about ma r ge rys g ardent he next morning after the garden was plan ted ma r ger yw a sup and out at six o clock she could not wait to look a the rg ardent o be sure she knew that these ed s could not sp rout in a single night but she had a feeling that might happen a tan y moment the garden was just as smooth and brown as the night before and no little see dl ing s were insight but a very few mornings after that when ma r ger y went out she saw afun ny little c rack opening up through the earth the whole length of the patch quickly she knelt down on the footpath to se eyes ti ny green leaves a whole row of them were pushing their way through the cru s tm ar ger y knew what she had put there it was the ra dish row these must b er a dish leaves she examined them very closely so that she might know a ra dish next time the little leaves n ob ig ger than half your little finger n ail grew in two s two on each ti n ys te m they were almost round ma r ger y flew back to her mother to say that the first see ds were up and her mother nearly as excited as ma r ger y came to look at the little c rack each day after that t hero wo fr a dishes grew till in a week it stood as high as your finger green and st urdy but about the third day while ma r ger y was stooping over the ra dishes she saw something very very small and green p ee p ing above ground where the let t uce was plan ted could i tb ew ee d sn o for on looking very closely she saw that the w ee leaves faint ly marked a regular row they did not make ac rack like the ra dishes they seemed too small and too far apart to push the earth up like that ma r ger y leaned down and looked wit hall her eyes at the baby plants the ti ny leaves grew two on as te man d were almost round the more she looked at them the more it seemed tom ar ger y that they looked exactly as the ra dish looked when it first came up do you suppose ma r ger y said to herself that let tu cea nd ra dish look alike while they are growing they don t look alike when they are on the table day by day the let t uce grew and soon the little round leaves were easier to examine they certainly w er every much like ra dish leaves the none morning while shew a ss e arch ing for sign so f others ee ds ma r ger y discovered the beet sin irregular patch e son t hero w hints of green

thought do you suppose we can have plan ted ra dishes forth o se little beet leaves were almost round and they grew two on as te m precisely like the let tu cea nd the ra dish except forth e size all three rows looked alike it was too much form ar ge rys he ran to the house and found her father her little face was so anxious that he thought something unpleasant had happened papas he said all out of breath do you think we could have made a mistake about my garden do you think we could have put ra dishes in all t hero ws father laughed what makes you thinks uch a thing he asked papas aid ma r

she heard what sd i co tyle don ou s said ma r ger y carefully wait till i come home to night dears aid her father and ill tell youth at evening ma r ger y was waiting eagerly for him when her father

this when they first come through you would not think a bi rc h tree could look like ave ge table o ra flower would you but it does at first it looks so much like these things that in the great nur

between a bi rc h tree and awe ed how fu nn y said ma r ger y dim pl ing ye sit sounds fu nn y said father bu tyo u see the bi rc h tree i sd i co tyle don ou s and so are many w ee ds and th edi co

h eri n his arms i hopes o dear he said the country i sa good place for little girls and that was all that happened that day the talkative to r to i se once upon a ti meat or to i se lived in a po nd with two du cks who were her very good friends she enjoyed the company of the du cks because she could talk with them to her hearts co n ten t the to r to i se liked to talks he always had something to s aya nd she liked to hear herself say it after many years of this pleasant living the po nd became very lo win a dry season and final ly i td r ied up the two du cks saw that they could no longer live there so they decided to fly to another re gi on where there was more water they went to the to r to i set o bid her good bye oh don t leave me behind begged the to r to i se take me with you i must die i fi am lef there bu tyo u cannot fly said the du ck show can we take you with u stake me with you take me with you said the to r to i set h ed u cks felt so sorry for her that at last they thought of away to take her we have thought of away which will be possible they said if only you can manage to keep still long enough we will each take hold of one end o fa stout st ick and do you take the middle in your mouth then we will fly u pi n the air with you and carry you with us but remember not total ki f you open your mouth you are lost the to r to i se s aids he would not s aya words he would not so much as move her m out hands h ewa s very grateful so the du cks brought a strong little st ick and took hold of the ends while the to r to i se bit firmly on the middle then the two du cks rose slowly in the ai ran d flew away with their burd en when they were above the tree top s the to r to i se wanted to say how high wear ebu t she remembered and kept still when they passed the church steep les he wanted to say what is that which shine s but she remembered and held her peace then they came over the village square and the people looked up and saw them look at the

look a ti t look the to r to i se forgot every thing except that she wanted to say hush you foolish people she opened her mouth and fell to the ground and that was the end of the to r to i se i tis a very good thing to be able to hold ones tongue robert o fs ic ily an old leg end says that there was once a king named robert o fs ic ily w how as brother to the great pop eo from e and to the e mp

words are in la ti n then said the ki n gang rily forth e ya real ie there i sn o power on earth o ri n heaven which can put me down from my seat and he sn ee red at the beautiful singing a she leaned back in his place presently the king fell asleep while the service went on he slept deeply and long when he awoke the church was dark and still and h ewa s all alone h eth e king had been left alone in the church to awake in the dark h ewa s fu rio us with r age and surprise and s tu mbl ing through th edi ma is les he reached the great doors and beat at them mad ly sh out ing for his servants the old s ext on heard some ones h out ing and p ound ing in the church and thought it was some drunk en va ga bond who had stolen in during the service he came to the door with his key s and called

men and women servants tried to stopt her agge d man who had somehow got into the pa lace but robert did note v en see them a she f led along st raight to the open doors of the b ig ba n qu et hall he made his w aya n dint o the midst of the grand f east there the great hall was filled with lights and flowers the tables were set with every thing that is delicate and rich to eat the court i ers in

the face of the king smiling at him with ar adi a nce like nothing on earth and a she sa nk to his knee s before the glory of that smile a voice sounded with the music like a me lo dy thro bb ing on a

and the jealous court i ers this i sit it seems there was once a very famous artist who lived in the little town of due ss e ld or fh edi d such fine work that the elect or prince jo ha nn wi lh e lm ordered a portraits ta tu eo f himself on horseback to be done in b ro nz eth e artist was over joy ed at the commission and worked early and late at the s ta tu eat last the work was done and the artist had the great s ta tu e set u pi n the public square of due ss e ld o rf ready forth e opening view the elect or came on the appointed d aya nd with him came his favourite court i ers from the cast le then the s ta tu ewa sun v ei l edi t was very beautiful so beautiful that the prince exclaimed in surprise he could not look enough and presently he turned to the artist and shook hands with him like an old friend her r gr u pel lo he said you are a great artist and this s ta tu e will make your fame even greater than i tis the portrait of me is perfect when the court i ers heard this and saw the friendly hand shake their jealousy of the artist was beyond bounds their one thought wa show could they safely do something to hum ili ate him they dared not pick f law sin the portraits ta tu e forth e prince had declared it perfect but a tl a stone o ft hems aid wi than air of great frank ness indeed her r gr u pel loth e portrait of his ro ya l high nessi s perfect but permit met o say that the s ta tu eo f the horse is not quite so successful the head is too large i tis out of proportion no said another the horse is really not so successful the turn of the neck there is awkward if you would change the right hind fo other r gr u pel lo said a third it would b ea n improvement still another found fault with the horses t ail the artist listened quietly when they had all finished he turned to the prince and said your court i ers prince find a good many f law sin the s ta tu eo f the horse will you permit met o keep i ta few days more to do what i can with it the elect or assented and the artist ordered a temporary screen to be built around the s ta tu e so th a this assistant s could work un disturbed for several days the sound o fh am me ring came steadily from behind the en clo sure the court i ers who took care to pass that way often were delighted each ones aid to himself i must have been right really the artist himself sees that something was wrong now i shall have credit for saving the prince s portrait by my artist ic taste once more the artist summoned the prince and his court i ers and once more the s ta tu ewa sun v ei led again the elect or exclaimed at its beauty and then he turned to his court i ers one after another to see what they had to say perfect said the first now that the horses head i sin proportion there is not af law the change in the neck was just what was needed said the second i tis very graceful now there ar right foot i sa sit should be now said a third and it add ss o much to the beauty of the whole the fourth said that he considered the t ail greatly improved my court i ers are much pleased now said the prince to her r gr u pel lo they think the s ta tu e much improved by the changes you have made her r gr u pel lo smiled a little ia m glad they are pleased he said but the fact i si have changed nothing what do you means aid the prince in surprise have we not heard the sound o fh am me ring everyday what were you ha m me ring at then iwa sh am me ring at the reputation of your court i ers who found faults imply because they were jealous said the artist and i rather think that their reputation is

ch e rry had been rather spoiled by his nurse when h ewa sa child she had always said to him that when he should become king he could do exactly a she pleased now after a while he began to find out that this was not true and it made him angry the first time that he noticed t hate v en a king could not always have his own way wa son a day when he went hunting it happened that he got no game this put him in such a bad temper that h eg rumble d and scolded all th ewa y home the little gold ring began to feel tight and uncomfortable when he reached the pa lace his pet do grant o meet him go away said the prince cross ly but the little dog was so used to being pet ted that he only jumped upon his master and tried to ki s shi shan d the prince turned and ki cked the little creature at the

that he would ruin himself and give them a chance to seize the thro n eh e treated his people carelessly and his servants cruel ly and every thing he wanted he felt that he must have the ring an no ye d him terribly it was embarrassing for a king to have a drop of blood on his finger all the ti meat last he took the ring off and put it out of sight then he thought he should be perfectly happy having his own way but instead he grew more unhappy a she grew less good whenever h ewa s crossed or could not have his own way instantly he flew into a passion final ly he wanted something that he really could not have this time it was a most beautiful young girl named ze lia the prince saw he ran d loved hers o much that he wanted at once to make her his queen to his great astonishment she refused a mi not pleasing to you asked the prince in surprise you ar every handsome very charming prince said ze lia bu tyo u are not like the good king your father i fear you would make m every

fight and make law s but w ed o not know just where they came from nor exactly how they lived these people left us some s ple n did stories about their kings their fight s and their beautiful women but i tall happened such along time ago that the stories are mixture so f things that really happened and what people said about them and we don t know just which is which the stories a recalled one of the pre t ties t leg ends is the story ia m going to tell you about the da g da sharp i tis said that there were two quite different kind so f people in ireland ones e to f people with long dark hair and dark eyes called fo mo ri an s they carried long sl end ers pe ars made of gold en b ro n ze when they f ought and another ra c eo f people who were gold en h aired and blue eye d and who carried short blunt heavy sp e ars of dull met al the gold en h aired people had a great chief ta in w how as also a kind of high pri es tw how as called the da g da and this da g da had a wonderful ma gi c harp the harp was beautiful to look upon mighty in size made o fr are wood and ornamented with gold and jewels and it had wonderful music in its string s which only the da g da could call out when them en were going out to battle the da g da would set up his ma gi c harp and sweep hi shan d across the string s and a war song would ring out which would make every war rio rb u ck le on hi sar m our brace his knee s and sh out forth to the fight then when them en came back from the battle weary and wounded the da g da would take hi sharp and strike a few ch o rd s and as them a gi c music s to le out upon the air every man forgot his weariness and the sm art of his w ounds and thought of the honour he had wo n and of th eco mr a de who had died be side hi man do f the safety of his wife and children then the song would swell out louder and every war rio r would remember only the glory he had helped win forth e king and each man would rise at the great table his cu pi n hi shan d and sh out long live the king there ca meat i me when the fo mo ri an s and the gold en h aired men were a tw a ran dint he midst o fa great battle while the da g da shall was not so well guarded as usual some of the chief ta in soft he fo mo ri an ss to let he great harp from the wall where it hung and f led away with it their wives and children and some few of theirs ol die rs went with them and they f led fa stand far through the night un ti l they were along way from the battle field then they thought they were safe and they turned aside into a vacant cast le b yt hero ad and sat down to a ba n qu et hanging the stolen harp on the wall the da g da with two or three of his war rio rs had followed hard on their t rack and while they were in the midst of their ba n qu et ing the door was suddenly burst open and the da g da stood there with his men some of the fo mo ri an ss p ran g to their feet but before any of them could gr a spa w ea po n the da g da called out to hi sharp on the wall come tom eo my harp the great harp re cogni s edi ts masters voice and lea ped from the wall whirling through the hall sweeping aside and k ill ing them en who got in its way its p

harmony s mo te upon the air the women of the fo mo ri an s bowed their head s and wept bitterly the strong men turned their faces aside and the little children so b bed again the da g da touched the

fell from their gr a spa nd the sp e ars dropped from their hands while the wine flowed from the broken bow ls they laughed un ti l their limb s were helpless with excess of glee once more the da g da touched hi sharp but very very softly and now a music s to le forth as soft as dreams and as sweet a sjo yi t was them a gi c music of sleep when they heard that gently gently the fo mo ri an women

young men bu tone was a lazy fellow and the other was a work er as the first sun beam s came over the hill s they sh one on a great cast le standing on the height sa s far away as the eye could see it was a wonderful and beautiful cast le all g listening to w ers that g lea me d like ma rb lea nd glancing windows that sh one like c rys ta l the two young men looked a ti t eagerly and longed to go nearer suddenly out of the distance something like a great butter fly of white and gold swept to w ard them and when it came nearer they saw that it was a most beautiful lady robe di n fl oa t ing gar

he has an easy time o fit he said but the in dust rio us man ran after the lovely lady and caught the he mo f her fl oa t ing robe in his gr a sp who are you and w hither are you going he asked ia m the fairy of fortune the beautiful lady said and that is my c astley ou may reach i tt o day if you will there is time if you waste none if you reach it before the last stroke of midnight i will receive youth er e and will be your friend but if you come one second after midnight it will be too late when she had said this her robe sl ipp ed from the travel ler shan d and shew as gone the in dust rio us man hurried back to his friend and told him what the fairy had said the ideas aid the lazy man and he laughed of course if we had a horse there would be some chance bu tall that way no thank youth en good bye said his friend ia m off and he set out down t hero ad to w ard th eshi n ing cast le with a good steady st ride his eyes st raight ahead the lazy man lay do w ninth e soft gr

turned round and there stood a little horse it was a dai n ty creature gentle looking and fine ly built and it was saddle d and br idle dh el lo said the lazy man luck often comes wh e none i sn t looking for i tan di n an instant he had lea pe don the horse and headed him forth e cast le of fortune the little horse started a ta fine pace and in a very few minutes they over took the other travel ler pl odd ing along on foot how do you likes ha nks po ny laughed the lazy ma nash e passed his friend the in dust rio us man only nodded and kept on with his steady st ride eyes st raight

his eyes and settled himself fo ran a pi t will go all the better for a little rest he said that asleep he slept like these v en sleep ers and he dream ed them o st beautiful things you could imagine at last he dream ed that he had entered the cast le of fortune and was being received with great fe s ti vi ties every thing he wanted was brought to hi man d music played while fire works were set off in his honour the music was so loud that he awoke he sat up rub b ing his eyes and behold the fire works were th every l astray soft he setting sun and the music was the voice of the other travel

and whist led and looked but no little horse appeared after along while he gave i tu p and since there was nothing better to do he mounted the old grey donkey and set out again the donkey was slow and h ewa s hard to ride but h ewa s better than nothing and gradually the lazy man saw the t owe r soft he cast le draw nearer no wit began to grow dark in the cast le windows the lights began to show then came troubles lower and s lower went the grey donkeys lower and s lower till in th every middle o fa pitch black wood he stopped and stood still no taste p would h ebu d ge for all th eco ax ing and scold ing and b eating his ride r could give at last the ride rk i cked him a swell as beat hi man da t that the donkey felt that he had had enough u pw en this hind he els and down w en this head and over it went the lazy man on to the s to ny ground there he lay gr oa n ing for many minutes for it was not a soft place i can assure you how he wished he were in a soft warm bed with his ach ing bone s comfortable in blank e ts th every thought o fit made him remember the cast le of fortune for he knew there must be fine beds there to get to those bed shew a seven willing to be stir his poor

in the b rier s and bu m ped his knee son the stone s but no donkey was there he would have laid down to sleep again bu the could h earn ow the how l so f hungry wo lves in the woods that it did not

mounted he felt that its side s were mo i stands lim yi t gave him as hud de ran dh e hesitated but at that moment he heard a distant clock strike it was striking eleven there was still time to reach the cast le of fortune but no more than enough so he mounted his news tee d and rode on once more the an i ma l was easier to sit on than the donkey and the saddle seemed remarkably high behind it was good to lea n against but event he donkey was not so slow as this then ews tee d was s lower than he after a while however he pushed his way out of the woods into the open and there stood the cast le only a little way ahead all its windows were ab la ze with lights a ra y from them fell on the lazy man sb ea stand he saw what h ewa s riding it was agig an tic sn ail a sn ail as large a sa ca l fa

then but from all side so f his strange an i ma l great arms came reaching up and held him fa stand in then extra yo f moonlight that broke the dark clouds he saw that h ewa s mounted on a mo ns ter c

long ago he lived high upon the mount a in side in a ti n yc ave his food was root s and a corn sa bit of bread given b ya p ea sa n to ra cheese brought b ya woman who wanted his pray ers his work was pray ing and thinking about god for forty years he lived so p reaching to the people pray ing forth em comfort ing them in trouble and most o fall worshipping in his heart there was ju stone thing he cared about it was to make his souls o pure and perfect that it could be one of the stone sing o ds great te m ple of heaven one day after the forty years he had a great longing to know how far along he had got with his work ho wit looked to the heaven ly father and he pray ed that he might be show na man whose soul in the heaven ly grace had grown to these lf same measure as his own whose treasure on the ce lest ia l sho re could neither be less than his nor more a she looked up from his pray er a white robe d angel stood in the path before him the her mi t bowed before the messenger with great gladness for he knew th a this wish was answered got o the nearest town the angel said and there in the public square you will find amount e bank a clo wn making the people laugh for money h ei s them any ou seek his soul has grown to these lf same s ta tu r ea s your own his treasure on the ce lest ia l sho r ei s neither less than yours nor more when the angel ha dfa d ed from sight the her mi t bowed his head again but this time with great sorrow and fear had his forty years of pray er been a ter r ible mistake and was his soul indeed like a clo wn fool ing in the market place he knew not what to think almost he hoped he should not find them an and could believe that he had dream edt he angel vision but when he came after along ti ring walk to the village and the square alas there was the clo wn doing his silly tricks forth e crowd the her mi t stood and looked at him with terror and sad ness for he felt that h ewa s looking a this own soul the face he saw was thin and tired and though it kept a smile o ra gr in forth e people it seemed very sad to the her mi t soon them an felt the her m its eyes he could not go on with his tricks and when he had stopped and the crowd had left the her mi t went and drew them an aside to a place where they could rest for he wanted more than anything else on earth to know what them an s soul was like because what it was his was so after a little he asked the clo wn very gently what his life was what it had been and the clo wn answered very sadly that it was just a sit looked a life of foolish tricks forth at was the only way of earn ing his bread that he knew but have you never been anything different asked the her mi t painful ly the clo wn s head sa n ki n his hands ye sho ly father he said i have been something else iwa sat h ie fi once belonged to them o st wicked band of mount a in robb ers t hate ver to r men t edt he land and iwa sa s wicked as the worst alas the her mi t felt th a this heart was breaking was this how he looked to the heaven ly father like a th ie fa cruel mount a in robb er he could hardly speak and the tears stream ed from hi sold eyes bu the gather ed strength to ask one more question ib egy ou he said if you have ever done a single good deed in your life remember it now and tell it tom e for he thought t hate ve none good deed would save him from utter despair yes one the clo wn said but it was so small i tis not worth telling my life has been worth less tell me that one plea d edt he her mi t once said them an our band broke into a co n vent garden and s to le away one of then uns to sell a sa slave or to keep for a ran so mw ed r agge d her with us over the rough long way to our mount a in camp and set a guard over her forth e night the poor thing pray edt ou ss o pi te ou sly to let her go and as she begged she looked from one hard face to another with trusting imp lo ring eyes a si f she could not believe men could be really bad father when her eyes met mine something pierced my heart pity and shame lea ped up forth e first time within m ebu ti made my face as hard and cruel as there stands he turned away hopeless when all was dark and still is to le like a ca tt o wheres he lay bound i put my hand on her wrist and whispered trust mean di will take you safely home icu the r bond s with my knife and she looked at met o show that she trusted father by ter r ible ways that ikne whi dd en from the others i took hers a fe to th eco n vent gates he knocked they opened and she sl ipp edi ns idea nda s she left me she turned and said god will remember that was all i could not go back to the old bad life and i had never learned an honest way to earn my bread so i became a clo wn and must b ea clo wn un t ili die non o my son cried the her

just as mine does as father you mock me said the clo wn but when the her mi t told him the story of his pray e ran d the angel s answer the poor clo wn was t ran s figured with joy for he knew th a this sins were forgiven and when the her mi t went home to his mount a in the clo wn went with him he too became a her mi tan d spent his time in praise and pray er together they lived and worked and helped the poor and when after two years them an who had been a clo wn died the her mi t felt that he had lost a brother more h oly than himself for ten years more the her mi t lived in his mount a in hut thinking always of god fa sting and pray ing and doing no least thing that was wrong the none day the wish once more came to know how his work was growing and once more he pray ed that he might see a being whose soul in the heaven ly grace had grown to these lf same measure as his own whose treasure on the ce lest ia l sho re could neither be less than his nor more once more his pray er was answered the angel came to hi man d told him to got oa certain village on the others id eo f the mount a in and to a small farm in it where two women lived in them he should find two souls like his owning o ds sight when the her mi t came to the door of the little farm the two women who lived there were over joy edt o see him forever y one loved and honoured his name they put a chair for hi month e cool po rc hand brought food and drink but the her mi t was too eager to wait he longed greatly to know what the souls of the two women were like and from their looks he could see only that they were gentle and honest o new a sold and the other of middle age presently he asked them about their lives they told him the little there was to tell they had worked hard always in the fields with their husbands o ri n the house they had many children they had seen hard times sickness sorrow but they had never despaired but what of your good deed s the her mi t asked what have you done for god very little they said sadly forth ey were too poor to give much to be sure twice every year when they killed a sheep for food they gave half to their poorer neighbours that is very good very faithful the her mi t said and is there any other good deed you have done nothing said the older woman unless unless it might be called a good deed she looked at the younger woman who smiled back a the r what said the her mi t still the woman hesitated but at lasts he said timid ly i tis not much to tell father only this that i tis twenty years since my sister in law and i came t olive together in the house we have brought u pour families here and in all the twenty years there has never been across word between u so ra look that was less thank in d the her mi tb en this head before the two women and gave thanks in his heart if my soul i sa s these he said ia m blessed indeed and suddenly a great light came into the her m its mind and he saw how many ways there are o fs er v ing god some serve

her mi tc limb edt he mount a in again he thought a she saw the s ta r like glow o flight in the cottage windows far how many god s hid d en servants are little got t lie b across the north sea in a country called ger many lived a little boy named got t lie b his father had died when h ewa s but a baby and although from early morning till late at night his m others at ply ing her need les he found it difficult indeed to provide food and clothing and shelter for her little boy and herself got t lie b was no told e nought o work bu the would often sit on a small s too la this m others feet and dream about the wonderful things he would do for his dear mother when he grew to beam an and shew as comforted as she looked upon her boy and the thought that shew as working for him often gave strength to her tired finger sb u tone night got t lie b saw th a this mother was more than usually trouble d every now and then she would sigh and a tear would trick le down her cheek the little boy had grown quick to read these sign so f distress and he thought christmas will be here soon and dear mother is thinking of what a sad time it will be what would got t lie b have given to be able to comfort his mother he could only si tan d brood while his young heart swelled and a lu m prose in his throat at the thought that he could do nothing presently however a happy fancy came to him was not the ch ri st child born on christmas d aya nd did no these nd good gifts to men on his birthday but then came the thought he will never find u sour home i ss o mean and small it seemed foolish to hope but abo yi s not long cast down and as got t lie b sat dreaming a happy inspiration came to him s tea l ing softly from t hero o mh e took paper and pen for he had learnt to write and spelt out word after word a letter which he addressed to the ch ri st child you may be sure that the post man was puzzled what to do with this letter when he sort edi t out of the heap in the letter box perhaps th ebu r go master would know the right thing to do so the post man took the letter to the great bu r ly man who lived in the b ig house and wore a gold ch a in round his neck th ebu r go master opened the en velope and as here ad the letter written in the trembling hand o fa child tears came into his eyes bu the spoke gr uf fly e nought o the post man this must b ea foolish boy a small one i have no doubts oo n christmas morning dawn ed and got t lie b wo k every early but others were up before him for to his surprise he saw a strange gentleman with his mother his wondering eyes soon perceived other unusual objects forth eh earth was pi led with wood and the table was l oad ed with food and dai n ties such a she had never even imagined got t lie b entered t hero om just as his mother threw herself at the strangers feet to bless him for his generous goodness to the widow and orphan nay give men o thanks worthy da me said the visitor rather be grateful to your little son and to the good lord to whom he wrote fo rai d then he turned to got t lie b with a smile you see that although you wrote to the ch ri st child your pray er fo rai d came only to th ebu r go master the gifts you asked for are here but they come from my hand but got t lie b answered him hum b ly n ays ir the ch ri st child sent them for he put the thought in your h earth ow the fir tree became the christmas tree when you stand round the christmas tree and look longing ly at the to ys hanging from the pri ck ly branch e sit does not occur to y out o ask why i tis always this particular tree that i ss o honoured at christmas the dark green fir looks so ma j es tic when la d en with bright to ys and li tu pb y christmas candles that perhaps i tis note a sy to believe that i tis them o st modest of trees but so i tis and because o fits humility it was chosen to bear christmas gifts to the children this is the story when the ch ri st child was born all people an i ma ls trees and other plants felt that a great happiness had come into the world and truly the heaven ly father had sent with the h oly ba be his blessings of peace and goodwill to all everyday people came to see the sweet ba be bringing presents in their hands by the stable where in lay the ch ri st child stood three trees and as the people ca mean d went under their spreading branch es they thought that they too would like to give presents to the child said the pa l mi will choose my b ig ge st leaf and place i ta sa fa n be side them anger to wa ft soft air to the child and i said the olive i will s pri nk le sweet smell ing oi lover him what can i give to the child asked the fir you said the others you have nothing to offer your need les would pri ck the w ee ba be and your tears a rest ick y this made the poor fir very unhappy indeed and it said sadly yes you are right i have nothing that would be good e nought o offer to the ch ri st child now quite near to the trees had stood an angel who had heard all that had passed h ewa s moved to pity the fir w how a ss o lowly and without envy of the other trees and he resolved to help it high in the dark of the heavens the stars were beginning to t wink lea nd the angel begged some of the little ones to come down and rest upon the branch e soft he fir this they were glad to do and their silver y lights h one among the branch es just like christmas candles from where he lay the ch ri st child could see the great dark evening world and the darker forms of the trees keeping watch like faithful guard ia n sb e side the open door of the stable and to its delight the fir trees aw the face of the ba be ill u mine d with a heaven ly smile a she looked upon the twinkling lights the ch ri st child did not forget the lovely sight and long after w ard he bad e that to cel eb rate his birthday there should be placed in every house a fir tree which might be li tu p with candles to shine forth e children as the stars sh one for him on his first
