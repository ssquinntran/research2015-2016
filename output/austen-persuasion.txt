handsome r at twenty nine than she waste n years before and generally speaking if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety i tis a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost it was so with

along un event ful residence i none country circle to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad no talents or accomplishments for home to occupy but now another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be added to these her father was growing distressed for money she knew that when he now took up the bar one t age it was to drive the heavy b ill s of his trade s people and the unwelcome hints of mr shepherd his age nt from his thoughts the kellynch property was good but not equal to sir w alter s apprehension of th estate required in its possess or while lady elliot lived there had been method moderation and eco no my which had just kept him within his income but with her had died all such right minded ness and from that period he had been constantly exceeding it it had not been possible for him to spend less he had done nothing but what sir w alter elliot was imperiou sly called on to do but blameless a shew a shew as not only growing dreadfully in debt but was hearing o fits o often that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer even partially from his daughter he had given hers o me hints o fit the last spring in town he had g ones o

expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to anne as had been the usual y early custom but these measures however good in themselves were insufficient forth e real extent of the evil the whole of which sir w alter found himself obliged to confess to hers o on afterwards elizabeth had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy she felt herself ill used and unfortunate as did her father and they were neither of them able to devise any means of lessening their expenses without com promising their dignity or re l in qu is h ing their comforts in away not to be borne there was only a small part of his estate that sir w alter could dispose of but had every acre been al i enable it would have made no difference he had c on de sc ended tom or tg age as

two confidential friends mr shepherd who lived in the neighbour ing market town and lady r us sell we recalled to advise them and both father and daughters e em ed to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassment s and red uce their ex pen d it u re without in volv ing the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride chapter mr shepherd a civil cautious lawyer who whatever might be his hold or his views on sir w alter would rather have the disagreeable prompted by any body else excused himself from offering the slightest hint and only begged leave to

ly adopt ed lady r us sell was most anxiously zeal ou son the subject and gave it much serious considerations he was a woman rather of sound than of quick abilities whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this instance were great from the opposition of two leading principles shew as of strict integrity herself with a delicate sense of honour but shew as as desirous of saving sir w alter s feelings as solicitous forth e credit of the family as ar is to cr at ic in her ideas of what was due to them as any body of sense and honesty could well be shew as a benevolent charitable good woman and capable of strong attachments most correct in her conduct strict in her notions of decorum and with manners that were held a standard of good breeding she had ac ult iv ate d mind and was generally speaking rational and consistent but she had prejudices on the side of an ces try she had a value for rank and consequence which blinded her a little to the faults of those who possessed them herself the widow of only a knight she gave the dignity of a bar one tall its due and sir w alter independent of his claims as an old acquaintance an attentive neighbour an obliging land lord the husband of her very dear friend the father of anne and her sisters was as beings irw alter in her apprehension entitled to a great deal of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties they must re tr en ch that did not admit of a doubt but shew as very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and elizabeth she drew up plans of eco no my she made exact calculation s and she did what nobody else thought of doings he consulted anne who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the questions he consulted and in a degree was influenced by her in marking out the scheme of re tr en ch men t which was at last submitted to sir w alter every e mend at io no f anne s had been on the side of honesty against importance she wanted more vigorous measures a more complete re formation a quicker release from debt a much higher tone of indifference forever y thing but justice and e quit y if we can persuade your father to all this said lady r us sell looking over her paper much may be done if he will adopt these re gul at i on sin seven years he will be clear and i hope we may be able to convince him and elizabeth that kellynch hall has a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these red ucti on s and that the true dignity of sir w alter elliot will b every far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people by acting like a man of principle what will he be doing in fact but what very many o four first families have done o rough t to do there will be nothing singular in his case and i tis singular it y which often makes the worst part o four suffering a sit always does o four conduct i have great hope of prevail ing we must be serious and decided for after all the person who has contracted debt s must pay them and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman and the head of a house like your father there is still more due to the character of an honest man this was the principle on which anne wanted her father to be proceeding his friends to be urging him she considered it as an act of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of credit or s wit hall the expedition which them o st com pre h en s iv e re tr en ch men ts could secure and saw no dignity in anything short o fits he wanted it to be prescribed and felt as a duty she rate d lady r us sell s influence highly and as to the severe degree of self denial which hero wn conscience prompted she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete than to ha l fare formation her knowledge of her father and elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of bot hands o on through the whole list of lady r us sell s too gentle red ucti

knocked off journey s london servants horse stable contract i on s and re strict i on s everywhere t olive no longer with the de c en cie seven of a private gentleman no he would sooner quit kellynch hall at once than remain in it on such disgrace ful terms quit kellynch hall the hint was immediately taken up by mr shepherd whose interest was involved in the reality of sir w alter s re tr en ch ing and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without a change of abode since the idea had been started in th every quarter which ought to dictate he had no scruple he said in confessing his judge men t to be entirely on that side it did not appear to him that sir w alter could materially alter his style of living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support in any other places irw alter might judge for himself and would be looked up to as re gul at ing the modes of life in whatever way he might choose to model his house holds irw alter would quit kellynch hall and after a very few days more of doubt and indecision the great question of w hither he should go was settled and the fir stout line of this important change made out there had been three alternative s london bath or another house in the country all anne s wishes had been forth e latter a small house in their own neighbourhood where they might still have lady r us sell s society still be near ma ry and still have the pleasure of sometimes seeing the lawn s and grove s of kellynch was the object of her ambition but the usual fate of anne attended her in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on she disliked ba than d did not think it agreed with her and bath was to be her homes irw alter had at first thought more of london but mr shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in london and had been skilful e nought o dissuade him from it and make bath preferred it was a much safer place for a gentleman in his predicament he might there be important at comparatively little expense two material advantages of bath over london had of course been given all their weight its more convenient distance from kellynch only fifty miles and lady r us sell s spending some part of every winter there and to th every great satisfaction of lady r us sell whose first views on the projected change had been for bath sir w alter and elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there lady r us sell felt obliged to oppose her dear anne s known wishes it would be too much to expect sir w alter to de sc en dint oa small house in his own neighbourhood anne herself would have found the mortifications o fit more than she foresaw and to sir w alter s feelings they must have been dreadful and with regard to anne s dislike of bath she considered it as a prejudice and mistake a rising first from the circumstance of her having been three years at school t hereafter her m others death and secondly from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards spent there with herself lady r us sell was fond of ba thin short and disposed to think it must suit them al land as to her young friends health by passing all the warm months with her at kellynchlodge every danger would be avoided and it was in fact a change which must do both health and spirits good anne had been too little from home too little seen her spirits were not high a larger society would improve t hems he wanted her to be more known the un desirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for sir w alter was certainly much strengthened by one part and a very material part of the scheme which had been happily engrafted on the beginning he was not only to qui this home but to see it in the hands of others a trial of fortitude which stronger head s than sir w alter s have found too much kellynch hall was to be let this however was apro found secret not to be breathe d beyond their own circles irw alter could not have borne the degradation of being known to design letting his house mr shepherd had once mentioned the word adver tis e but never dared approach it a gains irw alter spurn ed the idea o fits being offered in any manner for bad the slightest hint being dropped of his having such an intention and it was only on the supposition of his being spontaneous ly solicited by some most unexceptionable appli can to n his own terms and as a great favour that he would let it a tall how quick come the reasons for approving what we like lady r us sell had another excellent one a than d for being extremely glad that sir w alter and his family were to remove from the country elizabeth had been lately forming an intimacy which she wished to see interrupted it was with the daughter of mr shepherd who had returned after an un prosperous marriage to her fathers house with the additional burd en of two children shew as a clever young woman who understood t heart of pleasing t heart of pleasing at least at kellynch hall and who had made herself so acceptable to miss elliot as to have been already staying there more than once in spite o fall that lady r us sell who thought it a friendship quite out of place could hint of caution and reserve lady r us sell indeed had scarcely any influence with elizabeth and seemed to love her rather because she would love her than because elizabeth deserved it she had never received from her more than outward attention nothing beyond the observance s of complaisance had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry against previous inclinations he had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get anne included in the visit to london s en siblyo pent o all the injustice and all the d is credit of the selfish arrangements which shut hero u tan don many less er occasions had endeavoured to give elizabeth the advantage of hero wn better judge men t and experience but always in vain elizabeth would go hero wn way and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to lady r us sell t ha ninth is select io no f mrs c lay turning from the society of so deserving a sister to bestow her affection and confidence o none who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility from situation mrs c lay was in lady r us sell s estimate a very unequal and in her characters he believed a very dangerous companion and a removal that would leave mrs c lay behind and bring a choice of more suitable intimates within miss elliots reach was therefore an object of first rate importance chapter i must take leave to observe sir w alter said mr shepherd one morning at kellynch hall a she laid down the newspaper that the present junctu re is much in our favour this peace will be turning all our rich nav al officer sash o re they will be all wanting a home could not be a better times irw alter for having a choice often an ts very re sp on sible ten an ts many a noble fortune has been made during the war if a rich admir al were to come in our ways irw alter he would be a very lucky man shepherd replied sir w alter that s all i have to remark a prize indeed would kellynch hall be to him rather the greatest prize o fall let him have take never so many before he y shepherd mr shepherd laughed a she knew he must at this wit and then added i presume to observe sir w alter that in the way of business gentlemen of then avy are well to deal with i have had a little knowledge of their method s of doing business and i am free to confess that they ha v every liberal notions an dare as likely to make desirable ten an ts as any set of people one should meet with therefore sir w alter what i would take leave to suggest is that if in consequence of any rumour s getting abroad of your intention which must be contemplated as a possible thing because we know how difficult i tis to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other consequence has its tax i john shepherd might conceal any family matters that i chose for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me but sir w alter elliot has eyes upon him which it may b every difficult to elu de and therefore thus much i venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if wit hall our caution some rumour of the truths hould get abroad in the supposition of which as i was going to observe since applications will unquestionably follow i should think any from our wealth ynav al command ers particularly worth attending to and beg leave to add that two hours will bring me over at any time to save youth e trouble of replying sir w alter only nodded but soon afterwards rising and pacing t hero om he observed sarcastic all y there are few among the gentlemen of then avyi imagine who would not be surprise d to find themselves in a house of this description they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune said mrs c lay form rsc lay was present her father had driven hero ver nothing being of so mu chuse tom rsc lay s health as a drive to kellynch but i quite agree with my father in thinking as ail or might be a very desirable ten an ti have known a good deal of the profession and besides their liberality they are so neat and careful in all their ways these valuable pictures of yours sir w alter if you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe every thing in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of the gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now you need not be afraid miss ellio to f your own sweet flower gardens being neglected as to all that rejoined sir w alter coolly supposing i were induced to let my house i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be anne xed to it i am not particularly disposed to favour a ten an t the park would be o pent o him of course and few navy officer so r men of any other description can have had such a range but what re strict i on si might impose on the use of the pleasure grounds is another thing i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approach able and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden i am very little disposed to grant a ten an to fkellynch hall any extraordinary favour i assure you be he sail or or sold ier after a short pause mr shepherd presumed to say in all these cases there are established usage s which make every thing plain and easy between land lord and ten an t your interests irw alter i sin pretty safe hands depend upon me for taking care that note n an t has more than his just rights i venture to hint that sir w alter elliot cannot behalf so jealous for his own as john shepherd will be for him here anne spoke then avyi think who have done so much for us have at least an equal claim wi than y others e to f men for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can gives ail or s work hard enough forth eir comforts we must all allow very tru every true what miss anne says is very true was mr shepherd s re join de r and oh certainly was his daughters but sir w alter s remark was soon afterwards the profession has its utility but i should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it indeed was the reply and with a look of surprise yes i tis in two points off en s iv e tom ei have two strong grounds of objection to it first as being the means of bringing persons of obs cure birth into undue distinction and raising men to honours which their fathers and grand fathers never dreamt of and secondly a sit cut sup a man s youth and vigour most h or ribly as ail or grows old sooner than any other man i have observed i tall my life a man i sin greater danger in then avy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father his father might have disdain ed to speak to and of becoming premature ly an object of disgust himself than in any other line one day last spring in town i was in company with t women striking instances of what i am talking of lords t iv es whose father we all know to have been a country cu rate without bread to eat i was to give place to lords t iv es and a certain admir al b al d win them o st deplorable looking personage you can imagine his face the colour of m ah og any rough and rugged to the last degree all lines and wr in kles nine grey h

admir al b al d win i never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea fa ring life can do but to a degree i know i tis the same with them all they a real l knocked about and exposed to every

his notions and behaviour not likely to make the smallest difficulty abo utter ms only wanted a comfortable ho mean d to get into it as soon as possible knew he must pay for his convenience knew what

but made no great point o fits aid he sometimes took out agun but never killed quite the gentleman mr shepherd was eloqu en to n the subject pointing ou tall the circumstances of t head mir al s

and injustice of her fathers house and settled so permanently near herself but in this case anne had left nothing for advice to do and though lady r us sell as satisfied as ever with hero wn

recollections and feelings she could not h earth at captain went worth s sister was likely t olive at kellynch without are vi v al of former pain and many as trol land many a sigh were necessary to dispel the agitation of the ideas he often told herself it was folly before she could hard en her nerves sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the cr of ts and their business no evils he was assisted however by that perfect indifference and apparent un consciousness among the only three of hero wn friends in the secret of the past which seemed almost to deny any recollection o fits he could do justice to the superiority of lady r us sell s motives in this over those of her father and elizabeth she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness but the general air of obli vi

morning appointed for admira land mrs cr of ts seeing kellynch hall anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to lady r us sell s and keep out of the way till all was over when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them this meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory and decided the whole business at once each lady was previously well disposed for an agreement and saw nothing therefore but good manners in the other and with regard to the gentlemen there was such an hearty good humours uch an open trusting liberality on t head mir al ss ideas could not but influence sir w alter who had besides been flattered into his very be stand most polish ed behaviour by mr shepherd s assurances of his being known by report to

to work without there having been a single pre lim in ary difference tom od if yo fall that this in d en tu re shew eth sir w alter without hesitation declared t head mir al to be the best looking

set the th am e son fire but there seems to b en o harm in him re ciproc al compliments which would have been esteemed about equal the cr of ts were to have possession at michaelmas and as sir w alter proposed removing to ba thin the course of the pre ced ing month there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement lady r us sell convinced that anne would not be allowed to be of any use o ran y importance in the choice of the house which they were going to secure was very unwilling to have her hurried a ways o soon and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might convey her to bath herself after christmas but having engagements of hero wn which must take her from kellynch for several weeks shew as unable to give the full invitations he wished and anne though d reading the possible h eats of september in all the white gl are of ba than dgriev ing to fore go all the influence so sweet and so sad of the autumn al months in the country did not think that every thing considered she wished to remain it would be most right and most wise and therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others something occurred however to give her a different duty ma ry often a little unwell and always thinking a great deal of hero wn complaints and always in the habit of claiming anne when anything was the matter was indisposed and foreseeing that she should not have a days health all the autumn entreated or rather required her for it was hardly entreat y to come to upper cross cottage and bear her company as long as she should want her instead of going to bath i cannot possibly do without anne was ma rys reason ing and elizabeth s reply was then i am sure anne had better stay for nobody will want her in bath to be claimed as a good though in an improper style i sat least better than being rejected as no good a tall and anne glad to be thought of some use glad to have anything marked out as a duty and certainly not sorry to have the scene o fit in the country and hero wn dear country readily agreed to stay this invitation of ma rys removed all lady r us sell s difficulties and it was consequently soon settled that anne should not got o bath till lady r us sell took her and t ha tall the in terv en ing time should be divided between upper cross cottage and kellynchlodge sofa r all was perfectly right but lady r us sell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the kellynch hall plan when it burst on her which was mrs c lay s being engaged to got o bath with sir w alter and elizabeth as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her lady r us sell was extremely sorry that such a measures hould have been resorted to a tall wondered grieved and feared and the af front it contained to anne in mrs c lay s being of so mu chuse while anne could be of none was a very sore aggrav at i on anne herself was become hardened to such af front s but she felt the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as lady r us sell with a great deal of quiet observation and a knowledge which she often wished less of her fathers characters he was sensible that results them o st serious to his family from the intimacy were more than possible she did not imagine that her father had at present an idea of the kind mrs c lay had f re ckles and a project ing tooth and aclumsy wrist which he was continually making severe remarks upon in her absence but shew as young and certainly altogether well looking and possessed in an acute mind and as siduo us pleasing manners infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might have been anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger that she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptib let o her sisters he had little hope of success but elizabeth who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself should never she thought have reason to reproach her forgiving no war n ing she spoke and seemed only to offend elizabeth could not conceive how such an absurd suspicions hould occur to her and indignantly answered fo reach party s perfectly knowing their situation mrs c lay s aids he warmly never forgets who she is and as i am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be i can assure youth at upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice and that s here pro bates all inequality of condition an drank more strongly than most people and as tom y father i really should not have thought that he who has kept himself single so long for our sake s need be suspected now if mrs c lay were a very beautiful woman i grant you it might be wrong to have hers o much with me not that anything in the world i am sure would induce my father to make a degrading match but he might be rendered unhappy but poor mrs c lay who wit hall her merits can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty i really think poor mrs c lay may be staying here in perfect safety one would imagine you had never heard my fathers peak of her personal misfortunes though i know you must fifty times that tooth of hers and those f re cklesf re ckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him i have known a face not materially d is figured by a few but he abom in ate s them you must have heard him notice mrs c lay sf re ckles there is hardly any personal de fect replied anne which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to i think very differently answered elizabeth shortly an agreeable manner may set off handsome features but can never alter plain ones however at any rate as i have a great deal more at stake on this point than any body else can have i think it rather unnecessary in y out o be advising mean ne had done glad that it was over and not absolutely hopeless of doing good elizabeth though resent ing the suspicion mighty et be made observant by it the last office of the four carriage horses was to draws irw alter miss elliot and mrs c lay to bath the party drove off in very good spirits sir w alter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted ten an try and cottage rs who might have had a hint to show themselves and anne walked up at the same time in a sort of de so late tranquillity to the lodge wheres he was to spend the first week her friend was not in better spirits than herself lady r us sell felt this break up of the family exceedingly their respectability was as dear to her as hero wn and a daily intercourse had become precious by habit it was painful to look upon their deserted grounds and still worse to an ticip ate then ew hands they were to fall into and to escape the so l it ar in ess and the melancholy of so altered a village and be out of the way when admira land mrs cr of t first arrived she had determined to make hero wn absence from home begin when she must give up anne accordingly their removal was made together and anne was set down at upper cross cottage in the first st age of lady r us sell s journey upper cross was a moderate sized village which a few years back had been completely in the old english style containing only two houses superior in appearance to those of they eo men and labourers the mansion of the squi re with its high wall s great gates and old trees subs tan tia land un modern ized and the comp act tight par son age enclosed in its own neat garden with av in e and ap ear tree t rained round its casements but upon the marriage of the young squi re it had received the improvement of a farm house elevate dint oa cottage for his residence and upper cross cottage with its ver and a french windows and other pre tt in ess was quite as likely to catch the travel ler se y east he more consistent and considerable aspect and pre mis e soft he great house about a quarter of a mile farther on here anne had often been staying she knew the ways of upper cross a swell as those of kellynch the two families were so continually meetings o much in the habit of running in and out of each others house a tall hours that it was rather a surprise to her to find ma ry alone but being alone her being unwell and out of spirits was almost a matter of course though better end owed than the elder sister ma ry had not anne s understanding nor temper while well and happy and properly attended to she had great good humour and excellent spirits but any indisposition sunk her completely she had no resources for solitude and inheriting a considerable share of the elliot self importance was very prone to add to every other distress that of fancying herself neglected and ill used in persons he was inferior to both sisters and had even in her bloom only reached the dignity of being a fine girls he wa snow ly ing on the fa de d sofa of the pretty little drawing room the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing shabby under the influence of four summer s and two children an don anne s appearing greeted her with so you are come at last i began to think i should never see you i am so ill i can hardly speak i have not seen a creature the whole morning i am sorry to find you unwell replied anne you sent me such a good account of yourself on thurs day yes i made the best o fit i always do but i was very far from well at the ti mean did o not think i ever was so ill in my life as i have been all this morning very unfit to be left alone i am sure suppose i were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way and no table to ring the bell so lady r us sell would not get out i do not thinks he has be e ninth is house three times this summer anne said what was proper and enquired after her husband oh c ha rles is out shoot ing i have not seen him since seven o clock he would go though i told him ho will iwa she said he should not stay out long but he has never come back and no wit is almost one i assure you i have not seen a soul this whole long morning you have had your little boys with you yes as long as i could bear their noise but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good little c ha rles does not mind a word i say and w alter is growing quite as ba dwell you will soon be better now replied anne cheerfully you know i always cure you when i come ho ware your neighbours at the great house i can give you no account of them i have not see none of them to day except mr m us grove who just stopped and spoke through the window but without getting off his horse and though i told him ho will i was no tone of them have been near me it did not happen to suit them is sm us grove si suppose and they never put themselves out of their way you will see them yet perhaps before the morning is gone i tis early i never want them i assure youth ey talk and laugh a great dealt oo much form e oh anne i am so very unwell it was quite unkind of you not to come on thurs day my dear ma ry recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself you wrote in the cheerful lest manner and said you were perfectly well and inn o hurry for mean d that being the case you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with lady r us sell to the la stand besides what if elton her account i have really been so busy have had so much to do that i could not very conveniently have left kellynch sooner dear me what can you possibly have to do a great m anything si assure you more than i can recollect in a moment but i can tell you some i have been making ad up lic ate of the c at al ogue of my fathers books and pictures i have been several times in the garden with ma ck en zie trying to understand and make him understand which of elizabeth s plants are for lady r us sell i have had all my own little concerns to arrange books and music to divide and all my trunk store pack from not having understood in time what was intended as to the wag go ns an done thing i have had to do ma ry of a more trying nature going to almost every house in the parish as a sort of take leave i was told that they wished it bu tall these things took up a great deal of time oh well and after a moments pause but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the pooles yesterday did you go then i have made no en quiries because i concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party oh yes i went i was very well yesterday nothing a tall the matter with me till this morning it would have been strange if i had not gone i am very glad you were well enough and i hope you had a pleasant party nothing remarkable one always knows beforehand what the dinner will be and who will be there and i tis so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of ones own mr and mrs m us grove took mean d we were so crowded they are both so very large and take up so much room and mr m us grove always s its forwards o there was i crowded into the back seat with h en rietta and loui sea ndi think it very likely that my illness to day may be owing to it a little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on anne s side produced nearly a cure on ma rys she could soon sit upright on the sofa and began to hopes he might be able to leave it by dinner time then forgetting to think o fits he was at the o there n do ft hero om beau t if y ing an o se gay then s heat e her cold meat and then shew a swell e nought o propose a little walk wheres hall we go s aids he when they were ready i suppose you will not like to call at the great house before they have been to see you i have not the smallest objection on that account replied anne i should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i knows o well as mrs and them is sm us grove s oh but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible they ought to feel what is due to you as my sister however we may a swell go and sit with them a little while and when we have that over we can enjoy our walk anne had always thoughts uc hasty le of intercourse highly imprudent but she had ceased to endeavour to check it from believing that thought here were on each side continual subjects of offence neither family could now do without it to the great house accordingly they went to sit the full half hour in the old fashioned square parlour with a small carpet and sh in ing floor to which the present daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a grand pianoforte and a harp flowers t and s and little tables placed in every direction oh could the original soft he portraits against the wainscot could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on have been conscious of such an overthrow o fall order and neat ness the portraits themselves seemed to best a ring in astonishment them us grove s like their houses were in a state of alteration perhaps of improvement the father and mother were in the old english style and the young people in then ew mr and mrs m us grove were a very good sort of people friendly and hospitable not much educated and not a tall elegant their children had more modern minds and manners there was a numerous family but the only two grown up excepting c ha rles were h en rietta and lou is a young ladies of nineteen and twenty who had brought from school ate xeter all the usual stock of accomplishments and were now like thousands of other young ladies living to be fashionable happy and merry their dress had every advantage their faces were rather pretty their spirits extremely good their manner un embarrassed and pleasant they were of consequence at ho mean d favourite s abroad anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures of her acquaintance but still saved as we all are by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing forth e possibility of exchange she would not have given up hero wn more elegant and c ult iv ate d mind for all their enjoyments and envied them nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together that goodhumoured mutual affection of which she had known so little herself with either of her sisters they were received with great cordiality nothing seemed amiss on the side of the great house family which was generally as an n every well knew the least to blame the half hour was chatted away pleasantly enough and shew as not a tall surprise d at the end o fit to have their walking party joined by both them is sm us grove sat ma rys particular invitation chapter anne had not wanted this visit to upper cross to learnt hat a removal from ones e to f people to another though at a distance of only three miles will often in clu de a total change of conversation opinion and ideas he had never been staying there before without being struck by it or without wishing that o there lliots could have her advantage in seeing how unknown o run considered there were the affairs which at kellynch hall we retreated as of such general publicity and pervad ing interest yet wit hall this experience she believed she must now submit to feel that another lesson in t heart of knowing ou row n nothing ness beyond ou row n circle was become necessary for her for certainly coming as she did with a heart full of the subject which had been completely occupy ing both houses in kellynch for many weeks she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in the separate but very similar remark of mr and mrs m us grove so miss anne sir w alter and your sister are gone and what part of bath do you think they will settle in and this without much waiting for an answer or in the young ladies addition of i hope we shall be in ba thin the winter but remember papa if we dog owe must be in a good situation none of your queen square s for us or in the anxious sup ple men t from ma ry of upon my word i shall be pretty well off when you a real l gone away to be happy at bath she could only resolve to avoid such self delusion in future and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly sym path i sing friend as lady r us sell them rm us grove s had their own game to guard and to destroy their own horses dog s and newspaper s to engage them and the females were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping neighbours dress dancing and music she acknowledged it to b every fit t ing that every little social common wealth should dictate its own matters of discourse and hoped e re long to become a not unworthy m em be r of the ones he wa snow transplanted into with the prospect of spending at least two months at upper cross it was highly incumbent on her to cloth e her imagination her memory and all her ideas in as much of upper cross as possible she had no dread of these two months ma ry was not so repulsive and un sister ly as elizabeth nor so in accessib let o all influence of hers neither was there anything among the other comp one nt parts of the cottage in imic al to comforts he was always on friendly terms with her brother in la wan dint he children who loved her nearly a swell and respected her a great deal more than their m others he had an object of interest amusement and wholesome exertion c ha rlesm us grove was civil and agreeable in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife but not of powers or conversation or grace to make the past as they were connected together a tall a dangerous contemplation though at the same ti mean ne could believe with lady r us sell that a more equal match might have greatly improved him and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character and more usefulness rationality and elegance to his habits and pursuits a sit washed id nothing with much zeal but sport and his time was otherwise trifle d away without benefit from books or anything else he had very good spirits which never seemed much affected by his wife s occasional l own ess bore with her unreasonable ness sometimes to anne s admiration and upon the whole thought here was very often a little disagreement in which she had sometimes more share than she wished being appealed to by both parties they might pass for a happy couplet he y were always perfectly agreed in the want of more money and a strong inclination for a handsome present from his father but he reason most topics he had the superiority for while ma ry thought it a great shame that such a present was not made he always contend ed for his fathers having many other use s for his money and aright to spend it a she liked as to the management of their children his the or y was much better than his wife s and his practice not so bad i could manage them very well i fit were not form arys interference was what anne often heard him say and had a good deal of faith in but when listening in turn tom arys reproach of c ha rles spoil s the children so that i cannot get them into any orders he never had the smallest temptation to say very true one of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there wa she r being treated with too much confidence by all parties and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house known to have some influence with her sisters he was continually requested or at least receiving hints to exert it beyond what was practicable i wish you could persuade ma ry not to be always fancying herself ill was c ha r less language and in an unhappy mood thus spoke ma ryi do believe if c ha rles were to seemed y ing he would not think there was anything the matter with me i am sure anne if you would you might persuade him that i really am very ill a great deal worse than i ever own ma rys declaration was i hate sending the children to the great house thought heir grand m am ma is always wanting to see them for she humours and indulge s them to such a degree and gives t hems o much tr as hands we et things that they are sure to come back sick and cross forth e rest of the day and mrs m us grove took the first opportunity of being alone wi than ne to say oh miss anne i cannot help wishing mrs c ha rles had a little of your method with those children they are quite different creatures with you but to be sure in general they are so spoilt i tis a pity you cannot put your sister in the way of man ag ing them they are as fine healthy children as ever were seen poor little dears without partiality but mrs c ha rles knows no more how they should be treated bless me how troublesome they are sometimes i assure you miss anne it prevent s my wishing to see them a tour houses o often as i otherwise should i believe mrs c ha rles is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener but you know i tis very bad to have children with one that one is obli gate d to be checking every moment don t do this and don t do that or that one can only keep intolerable order by more cake than is good forth em she had this communication moreover from ma ry mrs m us grove thinks all her servants so steady that it would be high t reason to call it in question but i am sure without exaggeration that her upper housemaid and la un dry maid instead of being in their business are g adding about the village all day long i meet them wherever i go and i declare i never go twice into my nursery without seeing something of them if j em i ma were not the trust ie st steadiest creature in the world it would be e nought o spoil her for she tells me they are always tempting her to take a walk with them an don mrs m us grove s side it was i make a rule of never in terfe ring in any of my daughter in law s concerns for i know it would not do but i shall tell you miss anne because you may be able to set things to rights that i have no very good opinion of mrs c ha r less nursery maid i hear strangest or ies of hers he is always upon the gad and from my own knowledge i can declares he is such a fine dressing lady that she is e nought o ruin any servants she comes near mrs c ha rles quite s wear s by her i know but i just give youth is hint that you may be upon the watch because if you see anything amiss you need not be afraid of mentioning it again it was ma rys complaint that mrs m us grove was very apt not to give her the pre ced en ce that wa she r due when they dined at the great house with other families and she did not see any reason why shew as to be considered so much at hom east o lose her place an done day when anne was walking with only them us grove son e of them after talking o frank people o frank and jealousy o frank said i have no scruple of observing to you how nonsensical some persons are about their place because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it but iwi shan y body could give ma rya hint that it would be a great deal better if she were not so very ten acio us especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of m am ma nobody doubts her right to have pre ced en ce of m am ma but it would be more becoming in her not to be always in si sting on it i tis not that m am ma cares about it the least in the world but i know i tis taken notice of by many persons how was anne to se tall these matters to rights she could do little more than listen patiently soften every grievance and excuse each to the other give them all hints of the forbearance necessary betweens uch near neighbours and make those hints broad e st which were meant for her sisters benefit in all other respects her visit began and proceeded very well hero wn spirits improved by change of place and subject by being removed three miles from kellynch ma rysail men ts lessened by having a constant companion and their daily intercourse with the other family since there was neither superior affection confidence nor employment in the cottage to be interrupted by it was rather an advantage it was certainly carried nearly as far as possible forth ey met every morning and hardly ever spent an evening asunder but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight of mr and mrs m us grove s respectable forms in the usual places or without the talking laughing and singing of their daughters she played a great deal better t ha neither of them is sm us grove s but having no voice no knowledge of the harp and no fond parents to sit by and fancy themselves delighted her performance was little thought of only out of civility or to refresh the others as shew a swell aware she knew that when she played shew as giving pleasure only to herself but this was none w sensation excepting one short period of her life she had never since the age of fourteen never since the loss of her dear mother known the happiness of being listened too r encouraged by any just ap pre ci at io nor real taste in music she had been always used to feel alone in the world and mr and mrs m us grove s fond partiality forth ei row n daughters performance and total indifference to any other persons gave her much more pleasure for theirs akes than mortification for hero wn the party at the great house was sometimes increased by other company the neighbourhood was not large but them us grove s were visited by every body and had more dinner parties and mo recall ers more visitors by invitation and by chance than any other family there were more completely popular the girls were wild for dancing and the evenings ended occasionally in an un pre meditated little ball there was a family of cousins within a walk of upper cross in less afflu en t circumstances who depended on them us grove s for all their pleasures they would come at any ti mean d help play at anything or dance anywhere and an n every much p referring the office of musician to a more active post played country dances to them by the hour together a kindness which always recommended her musical powers to the notice of mr and mrs m us grove more than anything else and often drew this compliment well done miss an n every well done indeed lord bless me how those little finger s of yours fly about so passed the first three weeks michaelmas ca mean d now anne s heart must be in kellynch again a beloved home made over to others all the precious rooms and furniture grove s and prospects beginning to own o there yes and other limb s she could not think of much else on the of september and she had this sym path etic touch in the evening from ma ry who on having occasion to note down the day of the month exclaimed dear me is not this the day the cr of ts were to come to kellynchi am glad i did not think o fit before how lo wit makes met he cr of ts took possession with true nav al alertness and were to be visited ma ry deplore d the necessity for herself nobody knew how much she should suffers he should put it off as long as she could but was note as y till she had talked c ha rles into driving hero ver on a nearly day and was in a very animated comfortable state of imaginary agitation when she came back anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her goings he wished however to see the cr of ts and was glad to be within when the visit was returned they came the master of the house was not at home but the two sisters were together and a sit chance d that mrs cr of t fell to the share of anne while t head mir al sat by ma ry and made himself very agreeable by his goodhumoured notice of her little boys shew a swell able to watch for a likeness and i fit failed her in the features to catch it in the voice or in the turn of sentiment and expression mrs cr of t though neither tall nor fat had a square ness upright ness and vigour of form which gave importance to her persons he had bright dark eyes good tee than d altogether an agreeable face though her red d en ed and weather b eaten complexion the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea a she r husband made hers e em to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight and thirty her manners were open easy and decided like o new ho had no distrust of herself and no doubts of what to do without any approach to coarseness however o ran y want of good humour anne gave her credit indeed for feelings of great consideration towards herself in all that related to kellync hand it pleased her especially as she had satisfied herself in th every first half minute in the instant even of introduction that there was not the smallest symp tom of any knowledge or suspicion on mrs cr of ts side to give a bias of any sorts he was quite easy on that head and consequently full of strength and courage till for a moment elect r if ied by mrs cr of ts suddenly saying it was you and not your sister i find that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with when he was in this country anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing but the age of emotions he certainly had not perhaps you may not have heard that he is married added mrs cr of t she could now answer as she ought and was happy to feel when mrs cr of ts next words explained it to b em r went worth of whom she spoke that she had said nothing which might not do for either brothers he immediately felt how reasonable it was that mrs cr of t should be thinking and speaking o fed war d and not off red erick and with shame at hero wn forget fulness applied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbours presents t ate with proper interest there st was all tranquillity till just as they we removing she heard t head mir al say tom ary wear e expecting a brother of mrs cr of ts here soon i dares ay you k no whim by name he was cut short by the eager attack soft he little boys clinging to him like an old friend and declaring he should not go and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his co at pocket sc to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun anne was left to persuade herself a swell as she could that the same brother must still be in questions he could not however reach such a degree of certainty as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house where the cr of ts had previously been calling the folk soft he great house were to spend the evening of this day at the cottage and it being now too late in they ear for such visits to be made on foot the coach was beginning to be listened for when the youngest miss m us grove walked in that shew as coming to apologize and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves was the first black idea and ma ry was quite ready to be affronted when lou is am a deal l right by saying that she only came on foot to leave more room forth e harp which was bringing in the carriage and i will tell you our reasons he added and all about it i am come on to give you notice that papa and m am ma are out of spirits this evening especially m am ma she is thinking so much of poor richard and we agreed it would be best to have the harp for it seems to amuse her more than the pianoforte i will tell you why she is out of spirits when the cr of ts called this morning they called here afterwards did not they they happened to say that her brother captain went worth is just returned to england or paid of for something and is coming to see them almost directly and most unluckily it came into m am m as head when they were gone that went worth or something very like it was then am e of poor richard s captain a tone time i do not know when or where but a great while before he died poor fellow and upon looking over his letters and things she found it was so and is perfectly sure that this must be th every man and her head is quite full o fit and of poor richard s owe must be as merry as we can that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things there al circumstances of this path etic piece of family history were that them us grove s had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome hopeless son and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth y earth a the had been sent to sea because he was stupid and unmanageable on sho re that he had been very little cared for at any time by his family though quite as much a she deserved seldom heard of and scarcely a tall regretted when the intelligence of his death abroad had worked its way to upper cross two years before he had in fact though his sisters were now doing all they could for him by calling him poor richard been nothing better than a thick headed unfeeling un profitable dickm us grove who had never done anything to entitle himself to more than the abb re vi at io no f his name living or dead he had been several years at sea and ha dint he course of those removal s to which all mid ship men are liable and especially such mid ship men as every captain wishes to get rid of been six months on board captain f red erick went worth sfri gate the la c on ia and from the la c on i ah e had under the influence of his captain written the only two letters which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole of his absence that is to say the only two disinterested letters all there st had been mere applications for money in each letter he had spoken well of his captain but yet so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters so un observant and in curious were they as to the names of me nor ships that it had made scarcely any impression at the ti mean d that mrs m us grove should have been suddenly struck this very day with a recollection of then am e of went worth as connected with hers on seemed one of those extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occurs he had gone to her letters and found i tall as she supposed and there perusal of these letters after so long an interval her poor song one forever and all the strength of his faults forgotten had affected her spirits exceedingly and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death mr m us grove was in a less er degree affected likewise and when they reached the cottage they were evidently in want first of being listened to a new on this subject and afterwards o fall the relief which cheerful companions could give them to h earth em talking so much of captain went worth repeating his names o often puzzling over past years and at last ascertain ing that it might that it probably would turn out to be th every same captain went worth whom they recollected meeting once or twice after their coming back from clifton a very fine young man but they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago was a new sort of trial to anne s nerves she found however that it wa son e to which she must in u re herself since he actually was expected in the country she must teach herself to be insensible on such points and not only did it appear that he was expected and speedily but them us grove sin their warm gratitude forth e kindness he had shewn poor dick and very high respect for his characters t am peda sit was by poor dicks having been six months under his care and mentioning him in strong though not perfectly well spelt praise as a fine dashing fe low only two pert icu la r about the school master were bent on introducing themselves and seeking his acquaintance as soon as they could hear of his arrival the resolution of doings o helped to form the comfort of their evening chapter a very few days more and captain went worth was known to beat kellync hand mr m us grove had called on him and come back warm in his praise and he was engaged with the cr of ts to dine at upper cross by the end of another week it had been a great disappointment tom rm us grove to find that no earlier day could be fixed so impatient wa she to shew his gratitude by seeing captain went worth under his own ro of and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his cel la rs but a week must pass only a week in anne s reckoning and then she supposed they must meet and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week captain went worth made a very early return tom rm us grove s civility and shew as all but calling there in the same half hours he and ma ry were actually setting forward forth e great house where as she afterwards learnt they must inevitably have found him when they were stopped by the eldest boys being at that moment brought home in consequence of a bad fall the child s situation put the visit entirely aside but she could not hear of her escape with indifference eve ninth e midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards f elton his account his col la r bone was found to bed is loc ate d and such injury received in the back as roused them o st alarming ideas it was an afternoon of distress and anne had every thing to doat once the apothecary to send forth e father to have pursued and informed the mother to support and keep from hy st erics the servants to c on trol the youngest child to b an i shan d the poor suffering one to attend and soothe besides sending as soon as she recollected it proper notice to the other house which brought her an accession rather of frightened enquiring companions than of very useful assistant she r brothers return was the first comfort he could take best care of his wife and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary till he ca mean d had examined the child their apprehension s were the worse for being vague they suspected great injury but knew not where but now the col la r bone was soon re placed and though mr rob in son felt and felt and rub bed and looked grave and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt still they were all to hope the be stand to be able to part and eat their dinner intolerable ease of mind and then it was just before they parted that the two young aunt s were able sofa r to dig re ss from their nephews state as to give the information of captain went worth s visit staying five minutes behind their father and mother to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him how much handsome r how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance who had been a tall a favourite before how glad they had been to hear papa invite him to stay dinner how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power and how glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and m am m as farther pressing invitations to co mean d dine with the month e morrow actually on the morrow and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner as if he fel tall the motive of their attention just a she ought and in short he had looked and said every thing with such exquisite grace that they could assure them all their head s were both turned by him and off they ran quite as full of glee as of love and apparently more full of captain went worth than of little c ha r lest he same story and the same raptures were repeated when the two girls came with their father through the gloom of the evening to make en quiries and mr m us grove no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir could add his confirmation and praise and hope there would b en own o occasion for putting captain went worth off and only be sorry to think that the cottage party probably would not like to leave the little boy to give him the meeting oh no as to leaving the little boy both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to b earth e thought and anne in the joy of the escape could not help adding her warm protestation s to theirs c ha rlesm us grove indeed afterwards shewed more of inclination the child was going on so well and he wished so much to be introduced to captain went worth that perhaps he might joint h em in the evening he would not dine from home but he might walk in for half an hour but in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife with oh no indeed c ha rlesi cannot bear to have you go away only think if anything should happen the child had a good night and was going on well the next day it must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been done to the sp in e but mr rob in son found nothing to increase alarm and c ha rlesm us grove began consequently to feel no necessity for longer confinement the child was to be kept in bed and amused as quietly as possible but what was there for a father to do this was quite a female case and it would be highly absurd in him who could be of no u seat home to shut himself up his father very much wished him to meet captain went worth and there being no sufficient reason against i the ought to go and it ended in his making ab old public declaration when he came in from shoot ing of his meaning to dress directly and dine at the other house nothing can be going on better than the child said he so i told my father just now that i would co mean d he thought me quite right your sister being with you my love i have no scruple a tall you would not like to leave him yourself but you see i can be of no use anne will send form e if anything is the matter husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain ma ry knew from c ha r less manner of speaking that he was quite determined on going and that it would be of no u set o tea ze him she said nothing therefore till he was out of t hero om but as soon as there was only anne to hears o you and i are to be left to shift by ourselves with this poor sick child and not a creature coming near us all the evening i knew ho wit would be this is always my luck if there is anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out o fit and c ha rles is as bad as any of them very unfeeling i must say i tis very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy talks of his being going on so well how does he know that he is going on well or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence i did not think c ha rles would have been so unfeeling so here he is to go away and enjoy himself and because i am the poor mother i am not to be allowed to stir and yet i am sure i am more unfit than any body else to be about the child my being the mother is th every reason why my feelings should not be tried i am not a tall equal to it you saw how hy st eric al i was yesterday but that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm of the shock you will not be hy st eric al again i dares ay we shall have nothing to distress us i perfectly understand mr rob in sons directions and have no fears and indeed ma ryi cannot wonder at your husband nur sing does not belong to a man i tis no this province a sick child is always them others property hero wn feelings generally make its oi hope i am as fond of my child as any mother but i do not know that i am of any more use in the sick room than c ha rles for i cannot be always scold ing and tea z ing the poor child when i tis il land you saw this morning that if i told him to keep quiet he w assure to begin kic king about i have not nerves forth e sort of thing but could you be comfortable yourself to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy yes you see his papa can and why should not ij em i ma is so careful and she could send us word every hour how he was i really think c ha rles might a swell have told his father we would all come i am not more alarmed about little c ha rle snow than he is i was dreadfully alarmed yesterday but the case is very different to day well if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself suppose you were to go a swell as your husband leave little c ha r lest o my care mr and mrs m us grove cannot think it wrong while i remain with hi mare you serious cried ma ry her eyes bright en ing dear me that sa very good thought very good indeed to be sure i may just a swell go as not for i am of no u seat home am i and it only ha r as se s me you who have not am others feelings are a great dealt he properest person you can make little c ha rles do anything he always minds you at a word it will be a great deal better than leaving him only with j em i ma oh i shall certainly go i am sure i ought if i can quite as much as c ha rles forth ey want me excessively to be acquainted with captain went worth and i know you do not mind being left alone an excellent thought of yours indeed anne i will go and tell c ha rles and get ready directly you can send for us you know at a moments notice if anything is the matter but i dares ay there will be nothing to alarm you i should not go you may be sure if i did not feel quite at ease about my dear child the next moments he was tapp in gather husbands dressing room door and as anne followed her upstairs shew a sin time forth e whole conversation which began with ma rys saying in a tone of great exultation i meant o go with you c ha rles for i am of no more u seat home than you are if i were to shut myself up forever with the child i should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like anne will stay anne undertakes to stay at ho mean d take care of him i tis anne s own proposal and so i shall go with you which will be a great deal better for i have not dined at the other houses in ce tuesday this is very kind of anne wa she r husbands answer and i should b every glad to have you go but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself to nurse ours ick child anne wa snow a than d to take up hero wn cause and the sincerity of her manner beings o on sufficient to convince him where conviction was at least very agreeable he had no farther scruples as to her being left to dine alone though he still wanted her to joint h em in the evening when the child might beat rest forth e night and kindly urged her to let him co mean d fetch her but shew as quite unpersuadable and this being the cases he had e re long the pleasure of seeing t hems et off together in high spirits they were g ones he hoped to be happy however odd lyc on st ructed such happiness might seem as for herself shew as left with as many sensations of comfort as were perhaps ever likely to be hers she knew herself to be of the first utility to the child and what was it to her if f red erick went worth were only half a mile distant making himself agreeable to others she would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting perhaps indifferent if indifference could exist under such circumstances he must be either indifferent or unwilling had he wished ever to see her again he need not have waited till this time he would have done what she could not but believe that in his places he should have done long ago when events had be e nearly giving him the independence which alone had been wanting her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance and their visiting en er al there had been music singing talking laughing all that was most agreeable charming manners in captain went worth no shy nes so r reserve they seemed all to know each other perfectly and he was coming th every next morning to shoot with c ha rle shew as to come to breakfast but not at the cottage thought hat had been proposed at first but then he had been pressed to come to the great house instead and he seemed afraid of being in mrs c ha rlesm us grove s way on account of the child and therefore somehow they hardly knew ho wit ended inch ar less being to meet him to breakfast a this fathers anne understood i the wished to avoid seeing her he had inquired after hers he found slightly as might suit a former slight acquaintance seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged act u ate d perhaps by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet the morning hours of the cottage were always later than those of the other house an don the morrow the difference was so great that ma ry and anne were not more than beginning breakfast when c ha rles came into say that they were just setting off that he was come for his dog st ha this sisters were following with captain went worth his sisters meaning to visit ma ry and the child and captain went worth proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient and though c ha rles had answered forth e child s being inn o such state as could make it inconvenient captain went worth would not be satisfied without his running on to give notice ma ry very much gratified by this attention was delighted to receive him while a thousand feelings rushed on anne of which this was them o st consoling that it would soon be over and it was soon over in two minutes after c ha r less preparation the others appeared they were in the drawing room here ye half met captain went worth sa bow acurt se y passed she heard his voice he talked tom ary said all that was rights aid something to them is sm us grove se nought o mark an easy footing t hero om seemed full full of persons and voices but a few minutes ended it c ha rles shewed himself at the window all was ready their visitor had bowed and was gone them is sm us grove s were gone too suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the sports men t hero om was cleared and anne might finish her breakfast as she could i tis over i tis over she repeated to herself again and again in nervous gratitude the worst is over ma ry talked but she could not attends he had seen him they had met they had been once more in the same rooms o on however she began to reason with herself and try to be feeling less eight years almost eight years had passed since all had been given up how absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval had banished into distance and indistinctness what might not eight years do events of every description changes a lie n at i on s removal s all all must be comprised in it and obli vi o no f the past how natural how certain too it included nearly a third part of hero wn life alas wit hall her reasonings he found that to retentive feelings eight years may be little more than nothing now how were his sentiments to be read was this like wishing to avoid her and the next moments he was hating herself forth e folly which asked the question o none other question which perhaps her utmost w is do m might not have prevented shew as soon spared all suspense for after them is sm us grove s had returned and finished their visit at the cottage she had this spontaneous information from ma ry captain went worth is not very gallant by you anne though he was so attentive tom eh en rietta asked him what he thought of you when they went away and he said you were so altered he should not have known you again ma ry had no feelings to make her respect her sisters in a common way but shew as perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound altered beyond his knowledge anne fully submitted in silent deep mortification doubt less it was so and she could taken or even ge for he was not altered or not forth e worse she had already acknowledged it to herself and she could not think differently let him think of her a she would not he years which had destroyed her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing man ly open look inn o respect lessening his personal advantages she had seen the same f red erick went worth so altered that he should not have known her again these were words which could not but dwell with her yet she soon began to rejoice that she had heard them they were of sobering tendency they allay ed agitation they composed and consequently must make her happier f red erick went worth had used such words or something like them but without an i death at they would be carried round to her he had thought her wretchedly altered an dint he first moment of appeal had spoken a she felt he had not forgiven anne elliot she had used hi mill deserted and disappointed him and worse she had shewn a feebleness of character in doings o which his own decided confident temper could not endure she had given him up to oblige others it had been the effect of over persuasion it had been weakness and timidity he had been most warmly attached to her and had never seen a woman since whom he thought her equal but except from some natural sensation of curiosity he had no desire of meeting her again her power with him was gone forever it wa snow his object to marry he was rich and being turned on sho re fully intended to settle as soon a she could be properly tempted actually looking round ready to fall in love wit hall the speed which a clear head and a quick taste could allow he had a heart for either of them is sm us grove s if they could catch it a heart in short for any pleasing young woman who came in his way excepting anne elliot this was his only secret exception when he said to his sister in answer to her supposition s yes here i am so phia quite ready to make a foolish match any body between f if te en and thirty may have me for asking a little beauty and a few smiles and a few compliments to then avy and i am a lost man should not this be enough for as ail or who has had no society among women to make him nice he said it she knew to be contradicted his bright proud eye spoke the conviction that he was nice and anne elliot was not out of his thoughts when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to meet with a strong mind with sweetness of manner made the first and the last of the description that is the woman i wants aid he something a little inferior i shall of course put up with but it must not be much if i am a foolish all be a fool indeed for i have thought on the subject more than most men chapter from this time captain went worth and anne elliot were repeatedly in the same circle they were soon dining in company together at mr m us grove s forth e little boys state could no longer supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself and this was but the beginning of other dining s and other meetings whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each they could not but be r ever ted to they ear of their engagement could not but be named by him in the little narrative so r

c once iv ing it to be of equal pain they had no conversation together no intercourse but what the commonest civility required once so much to each other now nothing there had been a time when o fall the large party now filling the drawing room at upper cross they would have found it most difficult to cease to speak to one another with the exception perhaps of admira land mrs cr of t who seemed particularly attached and happy anne could allow no other exception seven among the married couple s there could have been not wo hearts so open no taste s so similar no feelings so in unison no countenance s so beloved now they were as strangers nay worse than strangers forth ey could never become acquainted it was a perpetual e strange men t when he talked she heard the same voice and discerned the same mind there was a very general ignorance o fall nav al matters throughout the party and he was very much questioned and especially by the two miss m us grove s who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him as to the manner of living on board daily re gul at i on s food hours can d their surprise a this accounts at learn ing the degree of accommodation and arrangement which was

thought about mean nesshud de ring s were to herself alone but them is sm us grove s could be as open as they were sincere in their exclamation s of pity and horror and so then i supposes aid mrs m us grove in a low voice as if thinking aloud so then he went away to the la c on ia and there he met wit hour poor boy c ha rles my dear be ck on ing him to her do ask captain went worth where it wa she first met with your poor brother i always forgot it was at gibr altar mother i know dick had been lef till at gibr altar with a recommendation from his former captain to captain went worth oh but c ha rles tell captain went worth he need not be afraid of mentioning poor dick before me for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend c ha rles being somewhat mo remind ful of the probabilities of the case only nodded in reply and walked away the girls were now hunting forth e la c on ia and captain went worth could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into his own hands to save them the trouble and once more read aloud the little statement of her name and rate and present non commission ed class observing over it that she too had be e none of the best friends ma never had ah those were pleasant days when i had the la c on ia how fast i made money in her a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cru is e together off the western is lands poor ha rv ill e sister you know how much he wanted money worse than myself he had a wife excellent fellow i shall never forget his happiness he felt i tall so much for hers akei wished for him again the next summer when i had still the same luck in them ed it er ran e an and i am sure sir said mrs m us grove it was a lucky day for us when you were put captain into that ship we shall never forget what you did her feelings made her speak lo wan d captain went worth hearing only in part and probably not having dickm us grove a tall near his thoughts looked rather in suspense and as if waiting for more my brother whispered one of the girls m am ma is thinking of poor richard poor dear fellow continued mrs m us grove he was grown so steady and such an excellent correspondent while he w asunder your care a hit would have been a happy thing if he had never left you i assure you captain went worth wear every sorry he ever left youth e re was a momentary expression in captain went worth s face at this speech a certain glance of his bright eye and curl of his handsome mouth which convinced anne that instead of sharing in mrs m us grove skin d wishes as to hers on he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him but it was too t ran si en tan indulgence of self amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself in another moment he was perfectly collected and serious and almost instantly afterwards coming up to the sofa on which she and mrs m us grove were sitting took a place by the latter and entered into conversation with her in a low voice about hers on doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was real and un absurd in the parents feelings they were actually on the same sofa form rsm us grove had most readily made room for him they were divided only by mrs m us grove it was no in significant bar rier indeed mrs m us grove wa sofa comfortable subs tan ti al size infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment and while the agitation sofa nnessl end er form and pensive face may be considered as very completely screen ed captain went worth should be allowed some credit forth e self command with which he attended to her large fat sighing s over the destiny of a son whom alive nobody had cared for personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions a large bulky figure has as good aright to be in deep affliction as them o st graceful set of limb sin the world but fair or not fair there are unbecoming c on juncti on s which reason will p at r on ize in vain which taste cannot tolerate which ridicule will seize t head mir al after taking two or three refreshing turns about t hero om with his hands behind him being called to order by his wife now came up to captain went worth and without any observation of what he might be interrupting thinking only of his own thoughts began with if you had been a week later at l is b on last spring f red erick you would have been asked to give a passage to lady ma rygrier son and her daughters should ii am glad i was not a week later then t head mir al abused him for his want of gallantry he defended himself though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies on board as hip of his excepting for a ball or a visit which a few hours might comprehend but if i know myself said he this is from no want of gallantry towards them i tis rather from feeling how impossible i tis wit hall ones efforts and all ones sacrifices to make the accommodations on board such as wo me nought to have there can b en o want of gallantry admir al in r at ing the claims of women to every personal comfort high and this is what i do i hate to hear of women on boar do r to see them on board and no ship under my commands hall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere if i can help it this brought his sister upon him oh f red erick but i cannot believe it of you all idle refinement women may be as comfortable on boarda sin the best house in england i believe i have lived as much on board as most women and i know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man of war i declare i have not a comfort o ran indulgence about me even at kellynch hall with a kind bow to anne beyond what i always had in most of the shipsi have lived in and they have been five altogether nothing to the purpose replied her brother you were living with your husband and were the only woman on board but you yourself brought mrs ha rv ill e her sister her cousin and three children round from p or ts mouth top ly mouth where was this sup er fine extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then all me rged in my friendship so phiai would assist any brother officer s wife that i could and i would bring anything of ha rv ill es from the worlds end if he wanted it but do not imagine that i did not feel i tan evil in itself depend upon it they were all perfectly comfortable i might not like them the better forth at perhaps such a number of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board my dear f red erick you are talking quite idly pray what would become of us poor sail or s wives who often want to be conveyed to one p or to r another after our husbands if every body had your feelings my feelings you see did not prevent my taking mrs ha rv ill e and all her family top ly mouth but i hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman and as if women were all fine ladies instead of rational creatures we none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days ah my dears aid t head mir al when he had got a wife he will sing a different tune when he is married if we have the good luck t olive to another war we shall see him do as you and i and a great many others have done we shall have him very thankful to any body that will bring him his wife ay that we shall now i have done cried captain went worth when once married people begin to attack me with oh you will think very differently when you are married i can only say no i shall not and then they say again yes you will and there is an end o fit he got up and moved away what a great travel ler you must have been ma am said mrs m us grove tom rscr of t pretty well ma am in the f if te en years of my marriage though many women have done more i have crossed t heat l an tic four times and have been once to the east in dies and back again and only once besides being indifferent places about home c or k and l is b on and gibr altar but i never went beyond the st r eight s and never was in the west in dies we do not call be r mud a or b ah am a you know the west in dies mrs m us grove had not a word to say in d is sent she could not accuse herself of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life an did o assure you ma am pursued mrs cr of t that nothing can exceed the accommodations of a man of war i speak you know of the higher rate s when you come to afri gate of course you are more confined though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy i none of them and i can safely say that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board as hip while we were together you know there was nothing to be feared thank god i have always been blessed with excellent health and no climate disagree s with me a little disordered always the first twenty four hours of going to sea but never knew what sickness was afterwards the only time i ever really suffered in body or mind the only time that i ever fancied myself unwell or had any ideas of danger was the winter that i passed by myself at deal when t head mir al captain cr of t then was in the north seas i lived in perpetual fright at that ti mean d had all manner of imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself or when i should hear from him next but as long as we could be together nothing ever ai led mean di never met with the smallest inconvenience a yet o be sur eyes indeed oh yes i am quite of your opinion mrs cr of t was mrs m us grove s hearty answer there is nothing so bad as a separation i am quite of your opinion i know what i tis form rm us grove always attends the as size s and i am so glad when they are over and he is safe back again the evening ended with dancing on its being proposed anne offered her services as usual and though her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she sat at the instruments he was extremely glad to be employed and desired nothing in return but to be un observed it was a merry joyous party and no one seemed in higher spirits than captain went worth she felt that he had every thing to elevate him which general attention and deference and especially the attention o fall the young women could do them is s hay ters the females of the family of cousins already mentioned were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him and as for h en rietta and lou is a they both seemed so entirely occupied by him that nothing but the continued appearance of them o st perfect goodwill between themselves could have made it c red ible that they were not decided rival s if he were a little spoilt by such universal such eager admiration who could wonder these were some of the thoughts which occupied anne while her finger s were mechanically at work proceeding for half an hour together equally without error and without consciousness once she felt that he was looking at herself observing her altered features perhaps trying to trace in them the ruin soft he face which had once charmed him and once she knew that he must have spoken of hers he was hardly aware o fit till she heard the answer but then shew assure of his having asked his partner whether miss elliot never danced the answer was oh no never she has quite given up dancing she had rather plays he is never tired of playing once too he spoke to hers he had left the instrument on the dancing being over and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished to give them is sm us grove s an idea of un intentionally she returned to that part of t hero om he saw her and instantly rising said with studied politeness i beg your pardon madam this is yours eat and though she immediately drew back with a decided negative he was not to be induced to sit down again anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches hi scold politeness his ceremonious grace were worse than anything chapter captain went worth was come to kellync has to a home to stay as long a she liked being as thoroughly the object of t head mir al sf rate rn al kindness as of his wife she had intended on first arriving to proceed very soon into shropshi re and visit the brothers ettle dint hat country but the attractions of upper cross induced him to put this off there was so much of friendliness and of flattery and of every thing most bewitching in his reception there the old were so hospitable the young so agreeable that he could not but resolve to remain where he was and take all the charm s and perfection so fed war ds wife upon credit a little longer it was soon upper cross with him almost everyday them us grove s could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come particularly in the morning when he had no companion at home forth eadmira land mrs cr of t were generally out of doors together interesting themselves in their new possession s their gr as s and theirs he ep and dawdling about in away note n durable to a third person or driving out in agig lately added to their establishment hitherto there had been bu tone opinion of captain went worth among them us grove s and their depend en cie sit was unvarying warm admiration everywhere but this intimate footing was not more than established when a certain c ha rles hay ter returned among them to be a good deal disturbed by it and to think captain went worth very much in the way c ha rles hay ter was the eldest o fall the cousins and a very amiable pleasing young man between whom and h en rietta there had been a considerable appearance of attachment previous to captain went worth s introduction he was in orders and having acuracy in the neighbourhood where residence was not required lived a this fathers house only two miles from upper cross a short absence from home had lef this fa iron eun guarded by his attentions at this critical period and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners and of seeing captain went worth mrs m us grove and mrs hay ter were sisters they had each had money but their marriages had made a material difference in their degree of consequence mr hay ter had some property of his own but it was in significant compared with mr m us grove s and while them us grove s were in the first class of society in the country the young hay ters would from their parents inferior retired and unpolished way of living and their own de fect iv e education have been hardly in any class a tall but forth eir connexion with upper cross this eldest son of course excepted who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman and who was very superior in cultivation and manners to all there st the two families had always been on excellent terms there being no pride o none s idea nd no envy on the other and only such a consciousness of superiority in them is sm us grove s as made them pleased to improve their cousins c ha r less attentions to h en rietta had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation it would not be a great match for her but if h en riett alike d him and h en rietta did seem to like him h en rietta fully thoughts o herself before captain went worth came but from that time cousin c ha rles had been very much forgotten which of the two sisters was preferred by captain went worth was as yet quite doubtful as far as anne s observation reached h en rietta was perhaps the pre t ties tlou is a had the higher spirits and she knew not now whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most likely to attract him mr and mrs m us grove either from seeing little or from an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters and o fall the young men who came n earth em seemed to leave every thing to take its chance there was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark about them in the mansion house but it was different at the cottage the young couplet here were more disposed to specu late and wonder and captain went worth had not been above four or five times in them is sm us grove s company and c ha rles hay ter had but just reappeared when anne had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister as to which was the one liked best c ha rles gave it for lou is am ary for h en rietta but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful c ha rles had never seen a pleasanter man in his life and from what he had once heard captain went worth himself say was very sure that he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war here was a fortune at once besides which there would be the chance of what might be done in any future war and he w assure captain went worth was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in then avyo hit would be a capital match for either of his sisters upon my word it would replied ma ry dear me if he should rise to any very great honours if he should ever be made a bar one t lady went worth sounds very well that would be a noble thing indeed for h en rietta she would take place of me then and h en rietta would not dislike that sir f red erick and lady went worth it would be but a new creation however and i never think much of your new creation sit suited ma ry best to think h en rietta the one preferred on th every account of c ha rles hay ter whose pretensions she wished to see put an end to she looked down very decidedly upon the hay ters and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the e xi sting connect i on between the families renewed very sad for herself and her children you knows aids he i cannot think him a tall a fit match for h en rietta and considering the alliances which them us grove s have made she has no right to throw herself away i do not think any young woman has aright to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the principal part of her family and be giving bad connect i on s to those who have not been used to them and pray who is c ha rles hay ter nothing but a country cu rate a most improper match for miss m us grove of upper cross her husband however would not agree with her here for besides having a regard for his cousin c ha rles hay ter was an eldest son and he saw things as an eldest son himself now you are taking nonsense ma ry was therefore his answer it would not be a great match for h en rietta but c ha rles has a very fair chance through the sp ice rs of getting something from the bi shop in the course of a year or two and you will please to remember that he is the eldest son whenever my uncle dies he steps into very pretty property the estate at win throp is not less than two hundred and fifty acre s besides the farm near t aunt on which is some of the best l an dint he country i grant youth at any of them but c ha rles would be a very shocking match for h en rietta and indeed it could not be he is the only one that could be possible but he is a very goodnatured good sort of a fellow and whenever win throp comes into his hands he will make a different sort of place o fit and live in a very different sort of way and with that property he will never be a contemptible man good free hold property non oh en rietta might do worse than marry c ha rles hay ter and if she has him and lou is a can get captain went worth i shall b every well satisfied c ha rles may say what he pleases cried ma ry to anne as soon a shew as out of t hero om but it would be shocking to have h en rietta marry c ha rles hay tera very bad thing for her and still worse for mean d therefore i tis very much to be wished that captain went worth may soon put him quite out of her head and i ha v every little doubt that he has she took hardly any notice of c ha rles hay ter yesterday i wish you had been there to see her behaviour and as to captain went worth s liking lou is aa swell a she nriettai tis nonsense to says o for he certainly does like h en riettaa great dealt he best but c ha rles is so positive i wish you had been with us yesterday forth en you might have decided between us and i am sure you would have thought as i did unless you had been determined to give it against me a dinner at mr m us grove s had been the occasion when all these things should have been seen by anne but she had staid at home under the mixed plea of a headache of hero wn and some return of indisposition in little c ha r less he had thought only of avoiding captain went worth but an escape from being appealed to as umpi re wa snow added to the advantages of a quiet evening as to captain went worth s views she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own m in dearly enough not to be endanger ing the happiness of either sister or imp each ing his own honour than that he should prefer h en riett at olou is a or loui sat oh en rietta either of them would in all probability make him an affectionate goodhumoured wife with regard to c ha rles hay ter she had delicacy which must be pained by any light ness of conduct in a well meaning young woman and a heart to sym path ize in any of the sufferings it occasioned but if h en rietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings the alter n at i on could not be understood too soon c ha rles hay ter had met with much to d is quiet and mortify him in his cousins behaviour she had too old a regard for him to be so wholly e strange d as might in two meetings ext ing u is h every past hope and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from upper cross but there was such a change as became very alarming when such a man as captain went worth was to be regarded as the probable cause he had been absent only two sunday s and when they parted had left her interested event o the height of his wishes in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy and obtaining that of upper cross instead it had then seemed the object nearest her heart that dr shirley there c to r who for more than forty years had been zeal ou sly d is c ha rg ing all the duties of his office but wa snow growing too in firm for many of them should be quite fixed on engaging acu rate should make his curacy quite as good a she could afford and should give c ha rles hay ter the promise o fit the advantage of his having to come only to upper cross instead of goings ix miles another way of his having in every respect a better curacy of his belonging to their dear dr shirley and of dear good dr shirleys being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through without most injurious fatigue had been a great deal event olou is a but had been almost every thing to h en rietta when he came back alas the zeal of the business was gone by lou is a could not listen a tall to his account of a conversation which he had just held with dr shirley shew a sat a window looking out for captain went worth and even h en rietta had at best only a divided attention to give and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude of then e got i at i on well i am very glad indeed but i always thought you would have it i always thought you sure it did not appear tom e that in short you know dr shirley must have acu rate and you had secured his promise i she coming lou is a one morning very soon after the dinner at them us grove sat which anne had not been present captain went worth walked into the drawing room at the cottage where were only herself and the little invalid c ha rles who was ly ing on the sofa the surprise of finding himself almost alone wi than neelliot deprived his manners of their usual composure he started and could only say i thought them is sm us grove s had been here mrs m us grove told me i should find them here before he walked to the window to recollect himself and feel how he ought to behave they are upstairs with my sister they will be down in a few moments i dares ay had been anne s reply in all the confusion that was natural and if the child had not called her to co mean d do something for him she would have been out of t hero om the next moment and released captain went worth a swell as herself he continued at the window and after calmly and polite ly saying i hope the little boy is better was silent shew as obliged to knee l down by the sofa and remain there to satisfy her patient and thus they continued a few minutes when to her very great satisfactions he heard some other person cross ing the little ve st ibule she hoped on turning her head to see the master of the house but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters easy c ha rles hay ter probably not a tall better pleased by the sight of captain went worth than captain went worth had been by the sight of anne she only attempted to say how do you do will you not sit down the others will be he represent ly captain went worth however came from his window apparently no till disposed for conversation but c ha rles hay ter soon put an end to his attempts by s eating himself n earth e table and taking up the newspaper and captain went worth returned to his window another minute brought another addition the younger boy a remarkable stout forward child of two years old having got the door opened for him by some one without made his determined appearance among them and went st raight to the sofa to see what was going on and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away there being nothing to eat he could only have some play and as his aunt would not let him t ease his sick brother he began to fasten himself upon her as she knelt in such away that busy as shew as about c ha r less he could not shake him off she spoke to him ordered entreated and insisted in vain once she did contrive to push him away but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly w alter s aids he get down this moment you are extremely troublesome i am very angry with you w alter cried c ha rles hay ter why do you not do as you are bid do not you hear your aunt speak come tom ew alter come to cousin c ha rles but not a bit did w alter stir in another moment however she found herself in th estate of being released from him some o new as taking him from her though he had bent down her head so much t ha this little st urdy hands were un fasten ed from around her neck and he was resolutely borne away before she knew that captain went worth had do neither sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speech less she could note v en thank him she could only hang over little c ha rles with most disordered feelings his kindness in step p ing forward to her relief the manner the silence in which it had passed the little particulars of the circumstance with the convictions o on forced on her by the noise he was st udiou sly making with the child that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks and rather sought to testify that her conversation was the last of his wants produced such a confusion of varying but very painful agitation as she could not recover from till enabled by the entrance of ma ry and them is sm us grove s to make over her little patient to their cares and leave the rooms he could not stay it might have been an opportunity of watching the loves and jealous ie soft he fourth ey were now altogether but she could stay for none o fit it was evident that c ha rles hay ter was not well inclined towards captain went worth she had a strong impression of his having said in a vex t tone of voice after captain went worth s interference you ought to have minded me w alter i told you not to tea ze your aunt and could comprehend his regret t ing that captain went worth should do what he ought to have done himself but neither c ha rles hay ters feelings nor any body s feelings could interest her till she had a little better arranged hero wn shew as ashamed of herself quite ashamed of beings o nervous so overcome by such a trifle but so it was and it required along application of solitude and reflection to recover her chapter other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur anne had soon been in company wit hall the four together often e nought o have an opinion thought oo wise to acknowledge as much at home wheres he knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife for while she considered loui sat o be rather the favourite she could not but think as far as she might dare to judge from memory and experience that captain went worth was not in love with either they were more in love with him yet there it was not love it was a little fever of admiration but it might probably must end in love with some c ha rles hay ter seemed aware of being slighted and ye then rietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them anne longed forth e power of representing to them all what they were about and of pointing out some of the evils they were expo sing themselves to she did not attribute gui let o any it was the highest satisfaction to her to believe captain went worth not in the least aware of the pain he was occasion ing there was no triumph no pitiful triumph in his manner he had probably never heard and never thought of any claims of c ha rles hay ter he was only wrong in accepting the attentions for accepting must be the word of two young women at once after a short struggle however c ha rles hay ter seemed to quit the field three days had passed without his coming once to upper cross a most decided change he had even refused one regular invitation to dinner and having been found on the occasion by mr m us grove with some large books before him mr and mrs m us grove were sure all could not be right and talked with grave faces of his study ing himself to death it was ma ry shop e and belief that he had received a positive d is miss al from h en rietta and her husband lived under the constant dependence of seeing him to morrow anne could only feel that c ha rles hay ter was wise one morning about this time c ha rlesm us grove and captain went worth being gone as hoot ing together as the sisters in the cottage were sitting quietly at work they were visited at the window by the sisters from the mansion house it was a very fine november day and them is sm us grove s came through the little grounds and stopped for no other purpose than to say that they were going to take along walk and therefore concluded ma ry could not like to go with them and when ma ry immediately replied with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker oh yes i should like to join you very much i am very fond of along walk anne felt persuaded by the looks of the two girls that it was precisely what they did not wi shan d admired again the sort of necessity which the family habits seemed to produce of every thing being to be communicated and every thing being to be done together however un desired and inconvenient she tried to dissuade ma ry from going but in vain and that being the case thought it best to accept them is sm us grove s much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise as she might be useful in turning back with her sister and lessening the interference in any plan of their own i cannot imagine why they should suppose i should not like along walks aid ma ry as she went upstairs every body is always supposing that i am not a good walker and yet they would not have been pleased if we had refused to joint h em when people come in this manner on purpose to ask u show ca none say no just as they were setting off the gentlemen returned they had taken out a young dog who had spoilt theirs p or t and sent them back early their ti mean d strength and spirits were therefore exactly ready forth is walk and they entered into it with pleasure could anne have foreseen such ajuncti on she would have staid at home but from some feelings of interest and curiosity she fancied now that it was too late to retract and the whole six set forward together in the direction chosen by them is sm us grove s who evidently considered the walk asunder their guidance anne s object was not to be in the way of any body and where the narrow path s across the fields made many separations necessary to keep with her brother and sister her pleasure in the walk must arise from the exercise and the day from the view of the last smiles of they ear upon the tawny leaves and wi there d hedges and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poet ic al description sex tan to f autumn that season of peculiar an dine x ha us tible influence on them in do f taste and tenderness that season which had drawn from every poet worthy of being reads o me attempt at description or some lines of feelings he occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musing s and quot at i on s but it was not possible that when within reach of captain went worth s conversation with either of them is sm us grove s she should not try to hear it yet she caught little very remarkable it was mere lively chat such as any young persons on an intimate footing might fall into he was more engaged with lou is a than with h en riett al ou is a certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister this distinction appeared to increase and there wa son e speech of lou is as which struck her after one of them any praises of the day which were continually burst ing forth captain went worth added what glorious weather forth eadmira land my sister they meant to take along drive this morning perhaps we may ha il them from some of these hill s they talked of coming into this side of the country i wonder w hereabouts they will up set to day o hit does happen very often i assure you but my sister makes nothing o fits he would as lie ve be to s se d out as not ah you make them os to fit i know cried lou is a but i fit were really so i should do just the same in her place if i loved a man as she loves t head mir al i would always be with him nothing should ever separate us and i would rather be over turned by him than driven safely by any body else it was spoken wi then thus i as m had you cried he catching the same tone i honour you and there was silence between them for a little while anne could not immediately fall into aquot at i on again the sweet scenes of autumn were for a while put by unless some tender son netfraught with t heap t analogy of the declining year with declining happiness and the image s of youth and hope and spring all gone together blessed her memory she roused herself to say as they struck by order into another pa this not this one of the ways to win throp but nobody heard or at least nobody answered her win throp however or its environs for young men are sometimes to be met with st roll ing about near home was their destination and after another half mile of gradual as c en t through large en clo sure s where the plough sat work and the fresh made path spoke the farmer counteract ing the sweet s of poet ic al de sp on d en ce and meaning to have spring again they gained the summ it of them o st considerable hill which parted upper cross and win throp and soon commanded a full view of the latter at the foot of the hill on the others i de win throp without beauty and without dignity was stretch ed before them an indifferent house standing lo wan dh em me d in by the bar ns and building sofa farm yard ma ry exclaimed bless me here is win thropi declare i had no idea well no within k we had better turn back i am excessively tired h en rietta conscious and ashamed and seeing no cousin c ha rles walking along any path or leaning against any gate was ready to do as ma ry wished but no said c ha rlesm us grove and non o cried lou is a more eagerly and taking her sister aside seemed to bear gu ing the matter warmly c ha rle sin the meanwhile was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt now that he was so near and very evidently though more fearfully trying to induce his wife to got oo but this wa son e of the points on which the lady shewed her strength and when he recommended the advantage of re sting herself a quarter of an hour at win thro pass he felt so tired she resolutely answered oh no indeed walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good and in short her look and manner declared that go she would not after a little success io no f these sort of debate s and consultation sit was settled between c ha rles and his two sisters that he and h en rietta should just run down for a few minutes to see their aunt and cousins while there s to f the party waited forth e mat the top of the hill lou is a seemed the principal arrange r of the plan and as she went a little way with them down the hill still talking to h en riett am ary took the opportunity of looking scornful ly around her and saying to captain went worth i tis very unpleasant having such connexions but i assure you i have never be e ninth e house above twice in my life she received no other answer than an artificial assent ing smile followed by a contemptuous glance a she turned away which anne perfectly knew the meaning of the b row of the hill where they remained was a cheerful spot lou is a returned and ma ry finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step o fast ile was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood about her but when lou is a drew captain went worth away to try for ag leaning of nut sin an adjoining hedge row and they were gone by degree s quite out of sight and sound ma ry was happy no longer she quarrelled with hero wn seat w assure lou is a had got a much better somewhere and nothing could prevent her from going to look for a better also she turned through the same gate but could not see them anne found a nice seat for hero na dry sun ny bank under the hedge row in which she had no doubt of theirs till being in some spot or other ma ry sat down for a moment but it would not do shew assure lou is a had found a better seat somewhere else and she would go on till she over took her anne really tired herself was glad to sit down and sh every soon heard captain went worth and lou is a in the hedge row behind her as if making their way back along the rough wild sort of channel down the centre they were speaking as they drew near lou is as voice was the first distinguished she seemed to be in the middle of some eager speech what anne first heard was and so i made her go i could not b earth at she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense what would i be turned back from doing a thing that i had determined to do and that i knew to be right by the airs and interference of such a person or of any person i may say no i have no idea of beings o easily persuaded when i have made up my mind i have made it and h en rietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at win throp to day and yet shew as as near giving it up out of nonsensical complaisance she would have turned back then but for you she would indeed i am almost ashamed to say it happy for her to have such a mind as yours a than d after the hints you gave just now which did but confirm my own observations the last time i was in company with hi mine ed not affect to have no comprehension of what is going on i see that more t ha name re dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question and woe be ti de him and her too when it comes to things of consequence when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind if she have not resolution e nought o resist idle interference in such a trifle as this your sister is an amiable creature but yours is the character of decision and firm nessi see if you value her conduct or happiness in fu seas much of your own spirit into her as you can but this no doubt you have been always doing i tis the worst evil of too yielding and in decisive a character that no influence over it can be depended on you are never sure of a good impression being durable every body may s way it let those who would be happy be firm here is an ut said he catching one down from an upper bought oex em pl if ya beautiful g loss ynut which

interested in is that they should be firm if lou is am us grove would be beautiful and happy in her november of life she will c her i shall her present powers of mind he had done and was unanswered it would have surprise d anne if lou is a could have readily answered such a speech words of such interests pok en with such serious warmth she could imagine what lou is a was feeling for herself she feared to move lest she should be seen while she remained ab us ho flow rambling holly protected her and they we removing on before they were beyond her hearing however lou is a spoke again ma ry is goodnatured enough in many respects s aids he but she does sometimes provoke me excessively by her nonsense and pride the elliot pride she has a great dealt oo much of the elliot pride we do so wish that c ha rles had married anne instead i suppose you know he wanted to marry anne after a moments pause captain went worth said do you meant hat she refused him oh yes certainly when did that happen i do not exactly know for h en rietta and i were at school at the time but i believe about a year before he married ma ryi wish she had accepted him we should all have liked her a great deal better and papa and m am ma always think it wa she r great friend lady r us sell s doing that she did not they think c ha rles might not be learned and book i she nought o please lady r us sell and that therefore she persuaded anne to refuse him the sounds were re tr eating and anne distinguished no more hero wn emotions still kept her fixed she had much to recover from before she could move the listeners proverb i al fate was not absolutely hers she had heard no evil of herself but she had heard a great deal of very painful imp or t she saw how hero wn character was considered by captain went worth and there had been just that degree of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extreme agitation as soon as she could she went after ma ry and having found and walked back with her to their former station by the st ile felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected and once more in motion together her spirits wanted the solitude and silence which only numbers could give c ha rles and h en rietta returned bringing as may be conjecture dc ha rles hay ter with them them in utiae of the business anne could not attempt to understand even captain went worth did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here but that there had been a with drawing on the gentleman ss idea nda relenting on the lady s and that they were now very glad to be together again did not admit a doubt h en rietta looked a little ashamed but very well pleased c ha rles hay ter exceedingly happy and they were devoted to each other almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for upper cross every thing now marked out lou is a for captain went worth nothing could be plainer and where many divisions were necessary or even where they were not they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two in along st rip of me a do w land where there wa sample space for all they were thus divided forming three distinct parties and to that party of the three which boasted least animation and least complaisance anne necessarily belonged she joined c ha rles and ma ry and was tired e nought ob every glad of c ha r less other arm but c ha rles though in very good humour with her was out of temper with his wife ma ry had shewn herself d is obliging to him and wa snow to re apt he consequence which consequence was his drop p ing her arm almost every moment to cut off the head s of some nettle sin the hedge with his s wit c hand when ma ry began to complain o fit and lament her being ill used according to custom in being on the hedges i de while anne was never incommoded on the other he dropped the arms of both to hunt after aw ease l which he had a momentary glance of and they could hardly get him along a tall this long me a do w bordered a lane which their footpath at the end o fit was to cross and when the party had all reached the gate of e xi t the carriage advancing in the same direction which had been some time heard was just coming up and proved to be admir al cr of tsgig he and his wife had taken their intended drive and were returning home upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired it would save her a full mile and they were going through upper cross the invitation was general and generally declined them is sm us grove s were not a tall tired and ma ry was either offended by not being asked before any of the others or what lou is a called the elliot pride could not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise the walking party had crossed the lane and were sur mount ing an opposite st ile and t head mir al was putting his horse in motion again when captain went worth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something to his sister the something might be guessed by its effects miss ellioti am sure you a retired cried mrs cr of t do let us have the pleasure of taking you home here is excellent room forth re ei assure you if we were all like you i believe we might sit four you must indeed you must anne was still in the lane and though instinctive ly beginning to decline shew as not allowed to proceed t head mir al skin d urgency came in support of his wife s they would not be refused they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a corner and captain went worth without saying a word turned to her and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage yes he had done it shew a sin the carriage and felt that he had placed her there t ha this will and his hands had done it that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue and his resolution to give her rest shew as very much affected by the view of his disposition towards her which all these things made apparent this little circumstances e em ed the completion o fall that had gone before she understood him he could not forgive her but he could not be unfeeling though condemn ing her forth epa stand considering it with high and unjust resentment though perfectly careless of her and though becoming attached to another still he could not see her suffer without the desire of giving her relief it was a remainder of former sentiment it was an impulse of pure though un acknowledged friendship it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart which she could not contemplate without emotions so compoun de do f pleasure and pain that she knew not which prevailed her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions were at first unconsciously given they had travelled half their way along the rough lane before shew as quite awake to what they s aids he then found them talking off red erick he certainly means to have one or other of those two girls so phy said t head mir al but there is no saying which he has been running after them too long enough one would think to make up his mind ay this comes of the peace i fit were war now he would have settled it long ag owes ail or s miss elliot cannot afford to make long courtship sin time of war how many days was it my dear between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our lodgings at north yar mouth we had better not talk about it my dear replied mrs cr of t pleasantly for if miss elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understandings he would never be persuaded that we could be happy together i had known you by character however long before well and i had heard of you as a very pretty girl and what were wet o wait for besides i do not like having such things so long in hand i wish f red erick would spread a little more can v as s and bring us home one of these young ladies to kellynch then there would always be company forth em and very nice young ladies they both are i hardly know one from the other very goodhumoured unaffected girls indeed said mrs cr of t in a tone of calmer praises uc has made anne suspect that her keen er powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy of her brother and a very respectable family one could not be connected with better people my dear admir al that post we shall certainly take that post but by coolly giving there in sa better direction herself they happily passed the danger and by once afterwards judicious ly putting out her hand they neither fell into arut nor ran foul of adung cart and anne with some amusement at theirs tyle of driving which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs found herself safely deposited by them at the cottage chapter the time now approached for lady r us sell s return the day wa seven fixed and anne being engaged to join her as soon as shew as re settled was looking forward to a nearly removal to kellync hand beginning to think how hero wn comfort was likely to be affected by it it would place her in the same village with captain went worth within half a mile of him they would have to frequent the same church and there must be intercourse between the two families this was against her but on the other hand he spent so much of his ti meat upper cross that in removing t hence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind than as going towards him and upon the whole she believed she must on this interesting question be the gainer almost as certainly a sin her change of domestic society in leaving poor ma ry for lady r us sell she wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing captain went worth at the hall those rooms had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painful ly before her but shew as yet more anxious forth e possibility of lady r us sell and captain went worth never meeting anywhere they did not like each other and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good and were lady r us sell to see them together she might think that he had too much self possession and she too little these points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating her removal from upper cross wheres he felt she had been station ed quite long enough her usefulness to little c ha rles would always gives o me sweetness to the memory of her two months visit there but he was gaining strength a pace and she had nothing else to stay forth e conclusion of her visit however was d iv ers if ied in away which she had not a tall imagined captain went worth after being unseen and unheard o fat upper cross for two whole

acquittal was complete his friendship warmly honoured a lively interest excited for his friend and his description of the fine country about ly me so feelingly attended to by the party that an earnest desire to see ly me themselves and a project for going thither was the consequence the young people were all wild to see ly me captain went worth talked of going there again himself it was only seventeen miles from upper cross though november the weather was by no means bad and in short loui saw ho was them o st eager of the eager having formed the resolution to go and besides the pleasure

not consent and when it came to be rationally considered a day in the middle of november would not leave much time for seeing a new place after de duct ing seven hours as the nature of the country required for going and returning they were consequently to stay the night there and not to be expected back till the next days dinner this was felt to be a considerable amendment and thought he y all

captain b en wick had some time ago been first lieut en an to f the la c on ia and the account which captain went worth had given of him on his return from ly me before his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and an officer whom he had always valued highly which must have st am ped him well in the esteem of every listener had been followed by a little history of his private life which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes o fall the ladies he had been engaged to captain ha rv ill es sister and wa snow mourning her loss they had been a year or two waiting for fortune and

than i am younger in feeling if not in fact younger as a man he will r all y again and be happy with another they all met and were introduced captain ha rv ill e was a tall dark man with a sensible benevolent countenance a little lame and from strong features and want of health looking much older than captain went worth captain b en wick looked and was the youngest of the three and compared with

manners was a perfect gentleman unaffected warm and obliging mrs ha rv ill ea degree less polish ed than her husbands e em ed however to have the same good feelings and nothing could be more pleasant than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own because the friends of captain went worth or more kindly hospitable than their entreaties forth eir all promising to dine with them the dinner already ordered at the inn was at last though un willingly accepted as a excuse but they seemed almost hurt that captain went worth should have brought any such party to ly me without considering it as a thing of course that they should dine with them there was so much attachment to captain went worth in all this and such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon so unlike the usual style of give and take invitations and dinners of formal it y and display that anne felt her spirits not likely to be benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother officer

but captain ha rv ill e had promised them a visit in the evening and he came bringing his friend also which was more than had been expected it having been agreed that captain b en wick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers he ventured among them again however though his spirits certainly did not seem fit forth e mirth of the party in general while captain s went worth and ha rv ill e led the talk o none side of t hero om and by recur ring to former days supplied anecdote sin abundance to occupy and entertain the others it fell to anne s lot to be placed rather apart with captain b en wick and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him he was shy and disposed to ab st r action but the engaging mildness of her countenance and gentleness of her manners soon had their effect and anne wa swell repaid the first trouble of exertion he was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading though principally in poet ry and besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evenings indulgence in the discussion of subjects which his usual companions had probably no concern in she had the hope of being of real u set o him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of st ruggl ing against affliction which had naturally grown out of their conversation for though shy he did not seem reserved it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints and having talked of poet ry the rich nes soft he present age and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as

tremulous feeling the various lines which image da broken heart or a mind destroyed by wretchedness and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poet ry and to say that she thought it was the misfortune of poet ry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were th every feelings which ought to taste it but spa ring ly his looks shewing him not pained but pleased with this allusion to his situations he was em b old en ed to go on and feeling in

declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like his note d down the names of those she recommended and promised to procure an dread them when the evening was over anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to ly met op reach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had never seen before nor could she help fearing on more serious reflection that like many other great moral is ts and p reach ers she had been eloqu en to na point in which hero wn conduct would ill bear examination chapter anne and h en rietta finding themselves the earliest of the party

spring twelvemonth he declares himself that coming to ly me for a month did him more good than all the medicine he took and that being by these a always makes him feel young again now i cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live entirely by these aid o think he had better leave upper cross entirely and fix at ly me do not you anne do not you agree with me that i tis the best thing he could do both for himself and mrs shirley she has cousins here you know and many acquaintance which would make it cheerful for her and i am sure she would be glad to get to a place wheres he could have medical attendance a than d in case of his having another seizure indeed i think it quite melancholy to have such excellent people as dr and mrs shirley who have been doing good all their lives we a ring out their last days in a place like upper cross where excepting our family they seems hut out from all the world i wish his friends would propose it to him i really think they ought and as to procuring ad is pen sat i on there could b en o difficulty a this time of life and with his character my only doubt is whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish he is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions over scrupulous i must say do not you think anne i tis being over scrupulous do not you think i tis quite a mistaken point of conscience when a clergyman sacrifices his health forth e sake of duties which may be just a swell perform ed by another person and at ly met oo only seventeen miles off he would be near e nought o hear if people thought there was anything to complain of anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech and entered into the subject as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of a young lady a sofa young man though here it was good of a lower standard for what could be offered but general acquiescence she said all that was reasonable and proper on the business felt the claims of dr shirley to re po seas she ought saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active respectable young man as a resident cu rate and wa seven court eo use nought o hint at the advantage of such resident cu rate s being married i wish said h en rietta very well pleased with her companion i wish lady r us sell lived at upper cross and were intimate with dr shirleyi have always heard of lady r us sell as a woman of the greatest influence with every body i always look upon her as able to persuade a person to anything i am afraid of her as i have told you before quite afraid of her because she is so very clever but i respect her amazingly and wish we had such a neighbour at upper cross anne was amused by h en riett as manner of being grateful and amused also that the course of events and then ew interests of h en riett as

subjects suddenly ceased on seeing lou is a and captain went worth coming towards them they ca meals o for as troll till breakfast was likely to be ready but lou is a recollecting immediately afterwards that she had something to procure at a shop invited them all to go back with her into the town they were all at her d is pos al when they came to the steps leading up war ds from the b each a gentleman at the same moment preparing to come down polite ly drew back and stopped to give them way they as c ended and passed him and as they passed anne s face caught his eye and he looked at her with a degree of earnest admiration which she could not be insensible of shew as looking remarkably well her very regular very pretty features having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind which had been bl owing on her complexion and by the animation of eye which it had also produced it was evident that the gentleman completely a gentleman in manner admired her exceedingly captain went worth looked round at her instantly in away which shewed his noticing o fit he gave her a momentary glance a glance of bright ness which seemed to say that man is struck with you and even i at this moments ee something like anne elliot again after attending lou is a through her business and lo it e ring about a little longer they returned to the inn and anne in passing afterwards quickly from hero wn chamber to their dining room had nearly run against th every same gentleman a she came out of an adjoining apartments he had before conjecture d him to be a stranger like themselves and determined that a well looking g room who was st roll ing about n earth e two inn s as they came back should be his servant both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea it wa snow proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves and this second meetings h or ta sit was also proved again by the gentleman s looks that he thought hers very lovely and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies that he was a man of exceedingly good manners he seemed about thirty and though not handsome had an agreeable person anne felt that she should like to know who he was they had nearly done breakfast when the sound of a carriage almost the first they had heard since entering ly me drew half the party to the window it was a gentleman s carriage acurricle but only coming round from the stable yard to the front door somebody must be going away it was driven by a servant in mourning the word curricle made c ha rlesm us grove jump up that he might compare it with his own the servant in mourning roused anne s curiosity and the whole six we recollected to look by the time the owner of the curricle was to be seen is su ing from the door amidst the bows and civilities of the house hold and taking his seat to drive off ah cried captain went worth instantly and with half a glance at anne i tis th every man we passed them is sm us grove s agreed to it and having all kindly watched him as far up the hill as they could they returned to the breakfast table the wait er came into the rooms o on afterwards pray said captain went worth immediately can you tell us then

land hid the arms so it did otherwise i am sure i should have observed them and the li very too if the servant had not been in mourning one should have known him by the li very putting all the s every extraordinary circumstances together said captain went worth we must consider it to be the arrangement of provide nce that you should not be introduced to your cousin when she could command ma rys attention anne quietly tried to convince her that their father and m re lliot had not for many years been on such terms as to make the power o fat tempting an introduction a tall desirable at the same time however it was a secret gratification to herself to have seen her cousin and to know that the future owner of kellynch was undoubtedly a gentleman and had an air of good senses he would not upon any account mention her having met with him the second time luck ily ma ry did not much attend to their having passed close by him in their earlier walk but she would have felt quite ill used by anne s having actually run against him in the passage and received his very polite excuses while she had never been near him a tall no that cousin ly little interview must remain a perfect secret of courses aid ma ry you will mention our seeing m re lliot the next time you write to bath i think my father certainly ought to hear o fit do mention all about him anne avoided a direct reply but it was just the circumstance which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated but as what ought to be suppressed the offence which had been given her father many years back she knew elizabeth s particulars h are in it she suspected and that m re lliots idea always produced irritation in both was beyond a doubt ma ry never wrote to bath herself all the to il of keeping up a slow and un satisfactory correspondence with elizabeth fell on anne breakfast had not been long over when they we rejoined by captain and mrs ha rv ill e and captain b en wick with whom they had appointed to take their last walk about ly me they ought to be setting off for upper cross by one an dint he meanwhile were to be all together and out of doors as long as they could anne found captain b en wick getting near her as soon as they were all fairly in the street their conversation the pre ced ing evening did not d is incline him to seek her again and they walked together some time talking as before of mrs cott and lord by r on and still as unable as before and as unable as any other two read ers to think exactly alike of the merits of either till something occasioned an almost general change amongst their party and instead of captain b en wick she had captain ha rv ill e by hers i de miss elliot said he speaking rather low you have done a good deed in making that poor fellow talks o much i wish he could have such company oftener i tis bad for him i know to be shut up a she is but what can we d owe cannot part no said anne that i can easily believe to be impossible but in time perhaps we know what timed oe sin every case of affliction and you must remember captain ha rv ill e that your friend may yet be called a young m our ner only last summer i understand ay true enough with a deep sigh only june and not known to him perhaps so soon not till the first week of august when he came home from the cape just made into the gr apple ri was at ply mouth d reading to hear of

it but that good fellow pointing to captain went worth the la c on ia had come into ply mouth the week before no danger of her beings en t to sea again he stood his chance forth e rest wrote up for leave of absence but without waiting the return travelled night and day till he got top or ts mouth r owed off to the gr apple r that instant and never left the poor fellow for a week that s what he did and nobody else could have saved poor james you may think miss elliot whether he is dear to us anne did think on the question with perfect decision and said as much in reply as hero wn feeling could accomplish or as his seemed able to bear for he was too much affected to re new the subject and when he spoke again it was of something totally different mrs ha rv ill es giving it a she r opinion that her husband would have quite walking enough by the time he reached home determined the direction o fall the party in what was to be their last walk they would accompany them to their door and then return and set off themselves by all their calculation s there was just time forth is but as they drew n earth ecobb there was such a general wish to walk along it once more all were so inclined and lou is a soon grew so determined that the difference of a quarter of an hour it was found would b en o difference a tall so wit hall the kind leave taking and all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which may be imagined they parted from captain and mrs ha rv ill eat their own door and still accompanied by captain b en wick who seemed to cl ing to them to the last proceeded to make the proper adieus to the cobb anne found captain b en wick again drawing near her lord by r on s dark blue seas could not fail of being brought forward by their present view and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as attention was possible it was soon drawn perforce another way there was too much wind to make the high part of then ewcobb pleasant forth e ladies and they agreed to get down the steps to the l owe randall were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight excepting loui sash e must be jumped down them by captain went worth in all their walks he had had to jump her from the st i lest he sensation was delightful to her the hard nes soft he pave men t for her feet made him less willing upon the present occasion he did it however shew as safely down and instantly to show her enjoyment ran up the steps to be jumped down again he advised her against it thought the j art oo great but no he reason ed and talked in vain she smiled and

looking on her with a face as p all id as hero wn in an agony of silence she is dead she is dead scream ed ma ry catching hold of her husband and contributing with his own horror to make him im move able and in another moment h en rietta sinking under the conviction lost her senses too and would have fallen on the steps but for captain b en wick and anne who caught and support ed her between them is there no one to help me were the first words which burst from captain went worth in a tone of despair and as i fall his own strength were gone got o him got o him cried anne for heavens sake got o

as urge on this instant was darting away when anne eagerly suggested captain b en wick would not it be better for captain b en wick he knows where as urge on is to be found every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea and in a moment it was all done in rapid moments captain b en wick had resigned the poor c or p se like figure entirely to the brothers care and was off forth e town with the utmost rapidity as to the wretched party left behind it could scarcely be said which of the three who were completely rational was suffering most captain went worth anne or c ha rles who really a very affectionate brother hung over lou is a with so bs of grief and could only turn his eyes from one sister to see the other in a state as insensible or to witness the hy st eric al

to be done next what in heavens name is to be done next captain went worth s eyes were also turned towards her had not she better be carried to the inn yes i am sure carry her gently to the inn yes yes to the inn repeated captain went worth comparatively collected and eager to be doing something i will carry her myself m us grove take care of the others by this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen and bo at men about the cob band many we recollected n earth em to be useful if wanted at any rate to enjoy the sight of a dead young lady nay two dead young ladies for it proved twice as fine as the first report to some of the best looking of these good people h en rietta was c on signed for though partially revived shew as quite helpless and in this manner anne walking by hers idea ndc ha rles attending to his wife they set forward t reading back with feelings un utter able the ground which so lately so very lately and so light of heart they had passed along they were not off the cobb before the ha rv ill es met them captain b en wick had been seen flying by their house with a countenance which show ed something to be wrong and they had set off immediately informed and directed as they passed towards the spot shocked as captain ha rv ill ewa she brought senses and nerves that could be instantly useful and a look between him and his wife decided what was to be done she must be taken to their house all must got o their house and a wait the s urge on s arrival there they would not listen to scruples he was ob eye d they were all beneath his ro of and while lou is a under mrs ha rv ill es direction was conveyed upstairs and given possession of hero wn bed assistance cordial s restoratives were supplied by her husband to all who needed them lou is a had once opened her eyes but soon closed them again without apparent consciousness this had been a proof of life however of service to her sister and h en rietta though perfectly incapable of being in the same room with lou is a was kept by the agitation of hope and fear from a return of hero wn insensibility ma ry too was growing calmer the s urge on was with them almost before it had seemed possible they were sick with horror while he examined but he was not hopeless the head had received a severe c on t us i on but he had seen greater injuries recovered from he was by no means hopeless he spoke cheerfully that he did not regard it as a desperate case that he did not say a few hours must end it was at first felt beyond the hope of mo stand the ec st as y of such are prieve the rejoicing deep and silent after a few fer vent ejaculation s of gratitude to heaven had been offered may be conceived the tone the look with which thank god was uttered by captain went worth anne w assure could never be forgotten by her north e sight of him afterwards a she sat near a table leaning over it with folded arms and face concealed as if overpowered by the various feelings of his soul and trying by pray er and reflection to calm them lou is as limb s had escaped there was no injury but to the head it now became necessary forth e party to consider what was best to be done as to their general situation they were now able to speak to each other and consult that lou is a must remain wheres he was however distressing to her friends to be in volv ing the ha rv ill e sins uch trouble did not admit a doubt her removal was impossible the ha rv ill es silenced all scruples and as much as they could all gratitude they had looked forward and arranged every thing before the others began to reflect captain b en wick must give up his room to them and get another bed elsewhere and the whole was settled they were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more and yet perhaps by putting the children away in the maids room or s win g ing acot somewhere they could hardly bear to think of not finding room for two or three besides supposing they might wish to stay though with regard to any attendance on miss m us grove there need not be the least uneasiness in leaving her tom rs ha rv ill es care entirely mrs ha rv ill e was a very experienced nurse and her nursery maid who had lived with her long and gone about with her everywhere was just such another between these two she could want no possible attendance by day or night and all this was said with a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible c ha rle she nrietta and captain went worth were the three in consultation and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror upper cross the necessity of some ones going to upper cross then ews to be conveyed ho wit could be broken tom r and mrs m us grove the lateness of the morning an hour already gone since they ought to have been off the impossibility of being intolerable ti meat first they were capable of nothing more to the purpose than such exclamation s but after a while captain went worth exerting himself said we must be decided and without the loss of another minute every minute is valuable some one must resolve on being off for upper cross instantly m us grove either you or i must go c ha rles agreed but declared his resolution of not going away he would be as little in cumb ran ce as possible to captain and mrs ha rv ill e but as to leaving his sister in such a state he neither ought nor would sofa r it was decided and h en rietta at first declared the same she however was soon persuaded to think differently the usefulness of her staying shew ho had not be enable to remain in lou is as room or to look at her without sufferings which made her worse than helpless shew as forced to acknowledge that she could don o good yet was still unwilling to be away till touched by the thought of her father and m others he gave it up she consented shew as anxious to beat home the plan had reached this point when anne coming quietly down from lou is as room could not but hear what followed forth e parlour door was o pent h en i tis settled m us grove cried captain went worth that you stay and that i take care of your sister home but as to there st as to the others if one stays to assist mrs ha rv ill ei think it need be only one mrs c ha rlesm us grove will of course wish to get back to her children but if anne will stay no ones o proper so capable as anne she paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself so spoken of the other two warmly agreed with what he said and she then appeared you will stay i am sure you will stay and nurse her cried he turning to her and speaking with a glow and yet a gentleness which seemed almost restoring the past she coloured deeply and he recollected himself and moved a ways he expressed herself most willing ready happy to remain it was what she had been thinking of and wishing to be allowed to do a be don the floor in lou is as room would be sufficient for her if mrs ha rv ill e would but thinks o one thing more and all seemed arranged though it was rather desirable that mr and mrs m us grove should be previously alarmed by some share of delay yet the time required by the upper cross horses to take them back would be a dreadful ex tens io no f suspense and captain went worth proposed and c ha rlesm us grove agreed that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn and leave mr m us grove s carriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early when there would be the farther advantage of sending an account of lou is as night captain went worth now hurried off to get every thing ready on his part and to be soon followed by the two ladies when the plan was made known tom ary however there was an end o fall peace in it shew as so wretched and so ve he men t complained so much of injustice in being expected to go away instead of anne anne who was nothing to lou is a while shew a she r sister and had the best right to stay in h en riett as s tea d why was not she to be as useful as anne and to go home without c ha r lest oo without her husband no it was too unkind and in short she said more than her husband could long with stand and as none of the others could oppose when he gave way there was no help for it the change of ma ry for anne was inevitable anne had never submitted more reluctant ly to the jealous and ill judging claims of ma ry but so it must be and they set off forth e town c ha rles taking care of his sister and captain b en wick attending to hers he gave a moments recollection as they hurried along to the little circumstances which the same spot s had witnessed earlier in the morning there she had listened to h en riett as schemes ford rshirleys leaving upper cross farther on she had first seen m re lliota moments e em ed all that could now be given to any

their manners what was to be theirs or to f intercourse she could not foresee it was all quite natural however he was devoted to h en rietta always turning towards her and when he spoke a tall always

question the just ness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage of firm ness of character and whether it might not strike him that like all other qualities of them in d it should have its proportions and limits she thought it could scarcely escape him to feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness as a very re so lute character they got on fast anne was astonished to re cogni set he same hill s and the same objects so soon their actual speed heightened by some dread of the conclusion made t hero ad appear but half as long a

corner with a shawl over her face giving the hope of her having cried herself to sleep when as they were going up their last hill anne found herself all at once addressed by captain went worth in a low cautious voice he said i have been considering what we had best do she must not appear at first she could not stand it i have been thinking whether you had not better remain in the carriage with her while i go in and break it tom r and mrs m us grove do you think this is a good plans he did he was satisfied and said no more but the remembrance of the appeal remained a pleasure to her as a proof of friendship and of deference for her judge men ta great pleasure and when it became a sort of parting proof its valued id not lessen when the distressing communication at upper cross was over and he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped and the daughter all the better for being with them he announced his intention of returning in the same carriage to ly mean d when the horses were ba it ed he was offend of volume one chapter the remainder of anne st i meat upper cross comprehending only two days was spent entirely at the mansion house and she had the satisfaction of knowing herself extremely useful there both as an immediate companion and as assisting in all those arrangements forth e future which in mr and mrs m us grove s distressed state of spirits would have been difficulties they had a nearly account from ly met he next morning lou is a was much the same no symptoms worse than before had appeared c ha rles came a few hours afterwards to bring a later and more particular account he was tolerably cheerful a speedy cure must not be hoped but every thing was going on a swell as the nature of the case admitted in speaking of the ha rv

early to their inn last night ma ry had been hy st eric al again this morning when he came a ways he was going to walk out with captain b en wick which he hoped would do her good he almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before but the truth was that mrs ha rv ill e left nothing for any body to do c ha rles was to return to ly met he same afternoon and his father had at first half a mind to go with him but the ladies could not consent it would be going only tom ult iply trouble to the others and increase his own distress and a much better scheme followed and was acted upon a chaise w assent for from c re wk her ne and c ha rles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery maid of the family o new ho having brought up all the children and seen th every last

captain went worth s appearing fixed in ly mean new as to leave the month e morrow an event which they all dreaded what should they do without her they were wretched comfort ers for one another and so much was said in this way that anne thoughts he could not do better than im part among them the general inclination to which shew as privy and persuaded them all to got oly meat once she had little difficulty it was soon determined that they would go got o morrow fix themselves at the inn or get into lodgings a sit suited and there remain till dear lou is a could be moved they must be taking off some trouble from the good people shew as with they might at least relieve mrs ha rv ill e from the care of hero wn children and in short they were so happy in the decision that anne was delighted with what she had done and felt that she could not spend her last morning at upper cross better than in assisting their preparations and sending them of fat a nearly hour though her being left to the solitary range of the house was the consequences he was the last excepting the little boys at the cottage shew as th every last the only remaining one o fall that had filled and animated both houses o

hour of yes term or n that captain went worth had been in kellynch yesterday the first time since the accident had brought anne the last note which she had not be enable to trace the exact steps of

well whenever it suits you you can s lip in from the shrubbery at any ti mean d there you will find we kee pour umbrellas hanging up by that door a good place is not it but checking himself you will not think it a good place for yours were always kept in the butler s room ay so it always is i believe one man s ways may be as good as another s but we all like ou row n be stands o you must judge for yourself whether it would be better for y out o go about the house or not anne finding she might decline it did so very gratefully we have mad every few changes either continued t head mir al after thinking a moment very few we told you about the la un dry door at upper cross that has been a very great improvement the wonder wa show any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience o fits opening a sit did so long you will tells irw alter what we have done and that mr shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had indeed i must do ourselves the justice to say that the few alteration s we have made have been all very much forth e better my wife should have the credit of them however i have don every little besides sending a ways o me of the large looking glasses from my dressing room which was your fathers a very good man and very much the gentleman i am sure but i should think miss elliot looking with serious reflection i should think he must be rather a dress y man for his time of life such a number of looking glasses oh lord there was no getting away from ones self so i got so phy to l end me a hand and we soon shifted their quarters and now i am quite snug with my little s having glass i none corner and another great thing that i never go near anne amused in spite of herself was rather distressed for an answer and t head mir al fearing he might not have been civil e nought ook up the subject again to say the next time you write to your good father miss elliot pray give him my compliments and mrs cr of ts and say that wear e settled here quite to our liking and have no fault a tall to find with the place the breakfast room chimney smoke sa little i grant you but i tis only when the wind is due north and blow s hard which may not happen three times a winter and take it altogether now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge there is no tone that we like better than this pray says o with my compliments he will be glad to hear it lady r us sell and mrs cr of t we r every well pleased with each other but the acquaintance which this visit began was fate d not to proceed far at present for when it was returned the cr of ts announced themselves to be going away for a few weeks to visit their connexions in the north of the county and probably might not beat home again before lady r us sell would be removing to bath so ended all danger to anne of meeting captain went worth at kellynch hall or of seeing him in company with her friend every thing was safe enough and she smiled over them any anxious feelings she had wasted on the subject chapter though c ha rles and ma ry had remained at ly me much longer after mr and mrs m us grove s going than anne conceived they could have been a tall wanted they were yet the first of the family to beat home again and as soon as possible after their return to upper cross they drove over to the lodge they had left lou is a beginning to sit up but her head

when she might be able to b earth e removal ho mean d her father and mother who must return in time to receive their younger children forth e christmas holidays had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them they had been all in lodgings together mrs m us grove had got mrs ha rv ill es children away as much as she could every possible supply from upper cross had been furnished to light en the inconvenience to the ha rv ill es while the ha rv ill es had been wanting them to come to dinner everyday and in short it seemed to have been only a struggle on each s ideas to which should be most disinterested and hospitable ma ry had had her evils but upon the whole as was evident by her staying so long she had found more to enjoy than to suffer c ha rles hay ter had been at ly me oftener than suited her and when they dined with the ha rv ill es there had been only a maid servant to wait and at first mrs ha rv ill e had always given mrs m us grove pre ced en ce but then she had received so very handsome an apology from hero n finding out whose daughters he was and there had been so much going on everyday there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the ha rv ill

gone to church and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at ly me than at upper cross and all this joined to the sense of beings o very useful had made really an agreeable fortnight anne enquired after captain b en wick ma rys face was cloud ed directly c ha rles laughed oh captain b en wick is very well i believe but he is a very odd young man i do not know what he would beat we asked him to come home with us for a day or two c ha rles undertook to give him some shoot ing and he seemed quite delighted and form y part i thought it was all settled when behold on tuesday night he made a very awkward sort of excuse he never s hot and he had been quite misunderstood and he had promised this and he had promised that and the end o fit was i found that he did not meant o come i suppose he was afraid of finding it dull but upon my word i should have thought we were lively enough at the cottage for such a heart broken man as captain b en wickc ha rles laughed again and said now ma ry you know very well ho wit really was it was all your doing turning to anne he fancied that if he went with u she should find you close by he fancied every body to be living in upper cross and when he discovered that lady r us sell lived three miles off his heart failed him and he had not courage to come that is the fact upon my honour ma ry knows i tis but ma ry did not give into it very graciously whether from not considering captain b en wick entitled by birth and situation to be in love wi than ellio to r from not wanting to believe anne a greater attraction to upper cross than herself must be left to be guessed anne s goodwill however was not to be lessened by what she heard she b old ly acknowledged herself flattered and continued here nquiries oh he talks of you cried c ha rle sins uch terms ma ry interrupted him i declare c ha rlesi never heard him mention anne twice all the time i was there i declare anne he never talks of you a tall no admitted c ha

he wants total k to you about them he has found out something or other i none of them which he thinks oh i cannot pretend to remember it but it was something very fine i overheard him telling h en

of miss elliots charm s and i am sure cried ma ry warmly it was a very little to his credit if he did miss ha rv ill e only died last june such a heart is very little worth having i sit lady r us sell i am sure you will agree with me i must see captain b en wick before i decides aid lady r us sell smiling and that you ar every likely to do very soon i can tell you ma am said c ha rles though he had

could have admitted of such difference of conjectures tea dy and matter of fact as i may call myself i have really a curiosity to see the person who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions i wish he may be induced to call here and when he does ma ry you may depend upon hearing my opinion but i am determined not to judge him beforehand you will not like him i will answer for it lady r us sell began talking of something else ma ry spoke with animation of their meeting with or rather missing m re lliot so extra ordinarily he is a man said lady r us sell whom i have no wish to see his declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family has left a very strong impression in his d is favour with me this decision checked ma rys eagerness and stopped her short in the midst of the elliot countenance with regard to captain went worth though anne hazarded no en quiries there was voluntary communications uffici en this spirits had been greatly recovering lately as might be expected as lou is a improved he had improved and he wa snow quite a different creature from what he had been the first week he had not seen lou is a and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview that he did not press for it a tall an don the contrary seemed to have a plan of going away for a week or tend ay still her head was stronger he had talked of going down top ly mouth for a week and wanted to persuade captain b en wick to go with him but as c ha rles maintained to the last captain b en wick seemed much more disposed to ride over to kellynch there can b en o doubt that lady r us sell and anne were both occasionally thinking of captain b en wick from this time lady r us sell could not h earth e door bell without feeling that it might be his her al d nor could anne return from any st roll of solitary indulgence in her fathers grounds o ran y visit of charity in the village without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him captain b en wick came not however he was either less disposed for it than c ha rles had imagined or he was too shy and after giving him a weeks indulgence lady r us sell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had been beginning to excite them us grove s came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school bringing with them mrs ha rv ill es little children to improve the noise of upper cross and lessen that o fly me h en rietta remained with lou is abu tall there s to f the family were again in their usual quarters lady r us sell and anne paid their compliments to

nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home loui saw a snow recovering a pace her mother could event h in k of her being able to join their party at home before her

noise sa swell a sin other matters and sounds are quite inn o xi o us or most distressing by theirs or t rather than their quantity when lady r us sell not long afterwards was entering bath on a wet afternoon and driving through the long course of streets from the old b rid get oc am d en place amidst the d as h of other carriages the heavy rumble of cart s and dr ays the bawl ing of newspaper men muffin men and milk men and the ceaseless cl in k of p at tens she made no complaint no these were noise s which belonged to the winter pleasures her spirits rose under their influence and like mrs m us grove shew as feeling though not saying that after being long in the country nothing could be so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness anne did not share these feelings she pers is ted in a very determined though very silent disinclination for bath caught the first dim view of the extensive building ssmo king in rain without any wish of seeing them better felt their progress through the streets to be however disagreeable yet too rapid for who would be glad to see her when she arrived and looked back with fond regret to the bustle s of upper cross and the seclusion of kellynch elizabeth s last letter had communicated apiece of news of some interest m re lliot was in bath he had called in c am d en place had called a second time a third had been pointedly attentive if elizabeth and her father did not deceive themselves had been taking much pains to seek the acquaintance and pro claim the value of the connect io nash e had formerly taken pains to shew neglect this was very wonderful i fit were true and lady r us sell was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about m re lliot already re can t ing the sentiments he had so lately expressed tom ary of his being a man whom she had no wish to sees he had a great wish to see him if he really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch he must be forgiven for having d is m em be red himself from the paternal tree anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance but she felt that she would rather seem re lliot again than not which was more than she could say for many other persons in bath shew as put down in c am d en place and lady r us sell then drove to hero wn lodgings in river s street chapters irw alter had taken a very good house in c am d en place al of ty dignified situations uc has becomes a man of consequence and both he and elizabeth were settled there much to their satisfaction anne entered it with a sinking heart anticipating an impri son men to f many months and anxiously saying to herself oh when shall i leave you again a degree of unexpected cordiality however in the welcome she received did her good her father and sister were glad to see her forth e sake of shewing her the house and furniture and met her with kindness her making a fourth when they sat down to dinner was noticed as an advantage mrs c lay was very pleasant and very smiling but her courtesies and smiles were more a matter of course anne had always felt that she would pretend what was proper on her arrival but the complaisance of the others was un looked forth ey were evidently in excellent spirits and shew as soon to listen to the causes they had no inclination to listen to her after laying out for some compliments of being deeply regretted in their old neighbourhood which anne could not pay they had only a few faint en quiries to make before the talk must be all their own upper cross excited no interest kellynch very little it was all bath they had the pleasure of assuring her that bath more than answered their expectations in every respect their house was undoubtedly the best in c am d en place their drawing rooms had many decided advantages over all the others which they had either seen or heard of and the superiority was not less in the style of the fit t ing up or the taste of the furniture their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after every body was wanting to visit them they had drawn back from many introductions and still were perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing here were funds of enjoyment could anne wonder that her father and sister were happy she might not wonder but she must sight hat her fathers hould feel no degradation in his changes hould see nothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident land h older should finds o much to be vain of in the littleness e sofa town and she must sigh and smile and wonder too as elizabeth threw o pent he folding doors and walked with exultation from one drawing room to the other boast ing of theirs pace at the possibility of that woman who had been mistress of kellynch hall finding extent to be proud of between two wall s perhaps thirty feet asunder but this was no tall which they had to make them happy they had m re lliot too anne had a great dealt o hear of m re llio the was not only pardoned they were delighted with him he had been in bath about a fortnight he had passed through ba thin november in his way to london when the intelligence of sir w alter s being settled there had of course reached him though only twenty four hours in the place but he had not be enable to avail himself o fit but he had now been a fortnight in ba than d his first object on arriving had been to leave his card in c am d en place following it up by such as siduo us endeavours to meet and when they did meet by such great openness of conduct such readiness to apologize forth e past such solicitude to be received as a relation again that their former good understanding was completely re established they had not a fault to find in him he had explained away all the appearance of neglect on his own side it had origin ate d in mis apprehension entirely he had never had an idea of throwing himself off he had feared that he was thrown off but knew not why and delicacy had kept him silent upon the hint of having spoken d is respectfully or carelessly of the family and the family honours he was quite indignant he who had ever boasted of being an elliot and whose feelings as to connect i on were only too strict to suit the unfeud al tone of the present day he was astonished indeed bu this character and general conduct must re futei the could refer sir w alter to all who kne whim and certainly the pains he had been taking on this the first opportunity of reconciliation to be restored to the footing of a relation and heir pre sumpt iv e was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject the circumstances of his marriage too were found to admit of much extenuation this was an article not to be entered on by himself but a very intimate friend of his a colonel wallis a highly respectable man perfectly the gentleman and not an ill looking man sir w alter added who was living in very good style in ma rlbo rough building s and had a this own particular request been admitted to their acquaintance through m re lliot had mentioned one or two things relative to the marriage which made a material difference in the d is credit o fit colonel wallis had known m re lliot long had been well acquainted also with his wife had perfectly understood the whole story shew as certainly not a woman of family but well educated accomplished rich and excessively in love with his friend there had been the charm she had sought him without that attraction no tall her money would have tempted elliot and sir w alter was moreover assured of her having been a very fine woman here was a great dealt o soften the business a very fine woman with a large fortune in love with him sir w alter seemed to admit it as complete apology and though elizabeth could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a lights he allowed it be a great extenuation m re lliot had called repeatedly had dined with them once evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked forth ey gave no dinners in general delighted in short by every proof of cousin ly notice and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in c am d en place anne listened but without quite understanding it allowances large allowances she knew must be made forth e ideas of those who spoke she heard i tall under em bell is h mental l that sounded extravagant or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin but in the language of there l at or s still however she had the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared in m re lliots wishing after an interval of so many years to be well received by them in a worldly view he had nothing to gain by being on terms with sir w alter nothing to risk by a state of vari an ce in all probability he was already t her ic hero f the two and the kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the t it lea sensible man and he had looked like a very sensible man why should it be an object to him she could only offer ones oluti on it was perhaps for elizabeth s sake there might really have been a liking formerly though convenience and accident had drawn him a different way and now that he could afford to please himself he might meant o pay his addresses to her elizabeth was certainly very handsome with well bred elegant manners and her character might never have been penetrated by m re lliot knowing her but in public and when very young himself how her temper and understanding might b earth e in ve st ig at io no f his present keen er time of life was another concern and rather a fearful one most earnestly did shew is h that he might not be too nice or too observant if elizabeth were his object and that elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so and that her friend mrs c lay was encouraging the idea seemed apparent by a glance or two between them while m re lliots frequent visits were talked of anne mentioned the glimpse s she had had of him at ly me but without being much attended too h yes perhaps it had been m re lliot they did not know it might be him perhaps they could not listen to her description of him they were describing him themselves sir w alter especially he did justice to his very gentlemanlike appearance his air of elegance and fashion his good shape d face his sensible eye but at the same time must lament his being very much under hung a de fect which time seemed to have increased nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature forth e worse m re lliot appeared to think that he sir w alter was looking exactly a she had done when they last parted but sir w alter had not be enable to return the compliment entirely which had embarrassed him he did not meant o complain however m re lliot was better to look at than most men and he had no objection to beings e en with him anywhere m re lliot and his friends in ma rlbo rough building s were talked of the whole evening colonel wallis had been so impatient to be introduced to them and m re lliot so anxious that he should and there was a mrs wallis at present known only to them by description as shew a sin daily expectation of her confinement but m re lliot spoke of her as a most charming woman quite worthy of being known in c am d en place and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted sir w alter thought much of mrs wallis shew as said to be an excessively pretty woman beautiful he longed to see her he hoped she might makes o me amends forth e many very plain faces he was continually passing in the streets the worst of bath was the number o fits plain women he did not meant o say that there were no pretty women but the number of the plain was out o fall proportion he had frequently observed a she walked that one handsome face would be followed by thirty or five and thirty f rights and once a she had stood in a shop on bond street he had count ed eight y seven women go by one after another without there being a tolerable face among them it had been a frost y morning to be sure a sharp frost which hardly one woman in a thousand could stand the tes to f but still there certainly were a dreadful m ult it u de of ugly women in ba than d as forth e men they were infinitely worse such s care c rows as the streets were full o fit was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything tolerable by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced he had never walked anywhere arm in arm with colonel wallis who was a fine military figure though s and yh aired without observing that every woman s eye was upon him every woman s eye w assure to be upon colonel wallis modest sir w alter he was not allowed to escape however his daughter and mrs c lay united in hinting that colonel wallis s companion might have as good a figure as colonel wallis and certainly was not s and yh aired how is ma ry looking s aids irw alter in the height of his good humour the last time i saw hers he ha dared no se but i hope that may not happen everyday oh no that must have been quite accidental in general she has been in very good health and very good looks since michaelmas if i thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp wind s and grow coarse i would send her an e what and pel is se anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown or acap would not be liable to any such mis use when a knock at the doors u spend ed every thing a knock at the door and so late it waste no clock could it b em re lliot they knew he was to dine in l an s down c re sc en t it was possible that he might stop in his way home to ask them how they did they could think of no one else mrs c lay decidedly thought it m re lliots knock mrs c lay was right wit hall th estate which a butler and foot boy could give m re lliot was ushered in t other o omit was the same th every same man with no difference but of dress anne drew a little back while the others received his compliments and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour but he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor her friend had taken cold the day before cc which was all as polite ly done and as polite ly taken as possible but her part must follow then sir w alter talked of his youngest daughter m re lliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter there was no occasion for remembering ma ry and anne smiling and blushing very becoming ly shewed tom re lliot the pretty features which he had by no means forgotten and instantly saw with amusement a this little start of surprise that he had not been a tall aware of who shew a she looked completely astonished but not more astonished than pleased his eyes brightened and with them o st perfect alacrity he welcomed the relations hip alluded to the pa stand entreated to be received as an acquaintance already he was quite as good looking a she had appeared at ly me his countenance improved by speaking and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be so polish ed so easy so particularly agreeable that she could compare them in excellence to only one persons manners they were not the same but they were perhaps equally good he sat down with them and improved their conversation very much there could b en o doubt of his being a sensible man ten minutes were e nought ocert if y that hi stone his expressions his choice of subject his knowing where to stop it was all the operation of a sensible discerning mind as soon a she could he began total k to hero fly me wanting to compare opinions respecting the place but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time to give his own route understands o me thing of hers and regret that he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to hers he gave him a short account of her party and business at ly me his regret increased a she listened he had spent his whole solitary evening in t hero om adjoining theirs had heard voices mirth continually thought they must be a most delightful set of people longed to be with them but certainly without the smallest suspicion of his possess ing the shadow of aright to introduce himself if he had but asked w hot he party were then am e of m us grove would have told him enough well it would serve to cure him of an absurd practice of never asking a question a tan inn which he had adopt ed when quite a young ma non the principal o fits being very un genteel to be curious the notions of a young man of one or two and twenty said h east o what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing are more absurd i believe than those of any others e to f beings in the world the folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view but he must not be addressing his reflections to anne alone he knew i the was soon diffuse d again among the others and it was only at intervals that he could return to ly me his en quiries however produced at length an account of the scenes he had been engaged in there soon after his leaving the place having alluded to an accident he must h earth e whole when he questioned sir w alter and elizabeth began to question also but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt she could only compare m re lliot to lady r us sell in the wish of really comprehending what had passed an dint he degree of concern for what she must have suffered in witnessing i the staid an hour with them the elegant little clock on the mantelpiece had struck eleven with its silver sounds and the watch man was beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same t al e before m re llio to ran y of them seemed to feel that he had been there long anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in c am d en place could have passed so well chapter there wa son e point which anne on returning to her family would have been more thankful to ascertain event h an m re lliots being in love with elizabeth which wa she r fathers not being in love with mrs c lay and shew as very far from easy about it when she had been at home a few hours on going down to breakfast the next mornings he found there had just been a decent pretence on the lady s side of meaning to leave t hems he could imagine mrs c lay to have said that now miss anne was comes he could not suppose herself a tall wanted for elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper that must not be any reason indeed i assure you i feel it none she is nothing tom e compared with you and shew a sin full time to hear her fathers ay my dear madam this must not b easy et you have seen nothing of bath you have been here only to be useful you must not run away from u snow you must stay to be acquainted with mrs wallis the beautiful mrs wallis to your fine mind i well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification he spoke and looked so much in earnest that anne was not surprise d to seem rsc lay s tea l ing a glance at elizabeth and herself her countenance perhaps might express some watch fulness but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister the lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties and promise to stay in the course of the same morning anne and her father chancing to be alone together he began to compliment hero n her improved looks he thought her less thin in her person in her cheeks her skin her complexion greatly improved clearer fresh er had she been using anything in particular no nothing merely go w land he supposed no nothing a tall h ah e was surprise d at that and added certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are you cannot be better than well or i should recommend go w land the constant use of go w land during the spring months mrs c lay has been using it at my recommendation and you see what it has done for her you see ho with as carried away her f re ckles if elizabeth could but have heard this such personal praise might have struck her especially a sit did not appear to anne that the f re ckles were a tall lessened but every thing must take its chance the evil of a marriage would be much dim in i she d if elizabeth were also to marry as for herself she might always command a home with lady r us sell lady r us sell s composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial on this point in her intercourse in c am d en place the sight of mrs c lay in such favour and of anne so overlook ed was a perpetual provocation to her there and vexed her as much when shew as away as a person in bath who drink s the water gets all then ew public at i on s and has a very large acquaintance has time to be vexed as m re lliot became known to hers he grew more charitable or more indifferent towards the others his manners were an immediate recommendation an don c on ver sing with him she found the so lid so fully support ing the sup erfici al that shew a sat first as she told anne almost ready to exclaim can this b em re lliot and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man every thing united in him good understanding correct opinions knowledge of the world and a warm h earth e had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour without pride or weakness he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune without display he judged for himself in every thing essential without defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum he was steady observant moderate can did never run away with by spirits or by selfishness which fancied itself strong feeling and yet with a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely and a value for all the felicities of domestic life which characters of fancied en thus i as m and violent agitation seldom really possess shew assure that he had not been happy in marriage colonel wallis said it and lady r us sell sa wit but it had been no unhappiness to sour his mind nor she began pretty soon to suspect to prevent his thinking of a second choice her satisfaction in m re lliot outweigh ed all the plague of mrs c lay it wa snows o me years since anne had begun to learnt hat she and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently and it did not surprise her therefore that lady r us sell should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent nothing to require more motives than appeared in m re lliots great desire of a reconciliation in lady r us sell s view it was perfectly natural that m re lliot at a mat u re time of life should feel it a most desirable object and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people to be on good terms with the head of his family the simple st process in the world of time upon ahead naturally clear and only er ring in the he y day of youth anne presumed however still to smile about it and at last to mention elizabeth lady r us sell listened and looked and made only this cautious reply elizabeth very well time will explain it was a refer en ce to the future which anne after a little observation felt she must submit to she could determine nothing at present in that house elizabeth must be fir stands he was in the habit of such general observance as miss elliot that any particularity of attentions e em ed almost impossible m re lliot too it must be remembered had not been a widower seven months a little delay on his side might b every excusable in fact anne could never see the crape round his hat without fearing that shew as the inexcusable one in attributing to him such imaginations for though his marriage had not been very happy still it had existed so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from the awful impression o fits being dissolved however it might end he was without any question their pleasantest acquaintance in bath she saw nobody equal to him and it was a great indulgence no wan d then total k to him about ly me which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again and to see more of as herself they went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many times he gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some earnestness she knew it we l lands he remembered another persons look also they did not always think alike his value for rank and connexions he perceived was greater than hers it was not merely complaisance it must be a liking to the cause which made him enter warmly into her father and sisters solicitudes on a subject which she thought unworthy to excite them the bath paper one morning announced the arrival of the do w age rv is count essd al rym plea nd her daughter the honourable miss carte re t and all the comfort of no c am d en place was swept away for many days forth ed al rymple sin anne s opinion most unfortunately were cousins of the elliots and the agony wa show to introduce themselves properly anne had never seen her father and sister before in c on t act with nobility and she must acknowledge herself disappointed she had hoped better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life and was red uced to form a wish which she had never foreseen a wish that they had more pride for our cousins lady d al rym plea nd miss carte re tour cousins the d al rymples sounded in here ars all day long sir w alter had once been in company with the late v is count but had never seen any of there s to f the family and the difficulties of the case arose from there having been a suspension o fall intercourse by letters of ceremony ever since the death of that said late v is count when in consequence of a dangerous illness of sir w alter sat the same time there had been an unlucky omission at kellynch no letter of condolence had been sent to ireland the neglect had been visited on the head of the s inn er for when poor lady elliot died herself no letter of condolence was received at kellync hand consequently there was but too much reason to apprehend that the d al rymples considered the relations hip as closed how to have this anxious business set to rights and be admitted as cousins again was the question and it was a question which in a more rational manner neither lady r us sell nor m re lliot thought un important family connexions were always worth preserving good company always worth seeking lady d al rymple had taken a house forth re e months in la ura place and would be living in styles he had been at bath they ear before and lady r us sell had heard her spoken of as a charming woman it was very desirable that the connexions hould be renewed i fit could be done without any com promise of propriety on the side of the elliots sir w alter however would choose his own means and at last wrote a very fine letter of ample explanation regret and entreat y to his right honourable cousin neither lady r us sell nor m re lliot could admire the letter but it did all that was wanted in bringing three lines of scrawl from the do w age rv is count ess shew as very much honoured and should be happy in their acquaintance the to il soft he business were over the sweet s began they visited in la ura place they had the cards of do w age rv is count essd al rym plea nd the honourable miss carte re t to be arranged wherever they might be most visible and our cousins in la ura place our cousin lady d al rym plea nd miss carte re t were talked of to every body anne was ashamed had lady d al rym plea nd her daughter even been very agreeable she would still have been ashamed of the agitation they created but they were nothing there was no superiority of manner accomplishment or understanding lady d al rymple had acquired then am e of a charming woman because she had a smile and a civil answer forever y body miss carte re t with still less to say was so plain and so awkward that she would never have been tolerated in c am d en place but for her birth lady r us sell confessed she had expected something better but yet it was an acquaintance worth having and when anne ventured to speak her opinion of them tom re llio the agreed to their being nothing in themselves but still maintained that as a family connexion as good company as those who would collect good company around them they had their value anne smiled and said my idea of good company m re llio tis the company of clever well informed people who have a great deal of conversation that is what i call good company you are mistaken said he gently that is not good company that is the best good company requires only birth education and manners and with regard to education is not very nice birth and good manners are essential but a little learn ing is by no means a dangerous thing in good company on the contrary it will do very well my cousin anne shake she r head she is not satisfied she is fastidious my dear cousin sitting down by her you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman i know but will it answer will it make you happy will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in la ura place and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible you may depend upon it that they will move in the first set in bath this winter and as rank is rank your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family our family let me say in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for yes sighed anne we shall indeed be known to be related to them then recollecting herself and not wishing to be answered she added i certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance i supposes mil ing i have more pride than any of you but i confess it does vex me that we should be so solicitous to have the relations hip acknowledged which we may b every sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them pardon me dear cousin you are unjust in your own claims in london perhaps in your present quiet style of living it might b easy ou say but in bath sir w alter elliot and his family will always be worth knowing always acceptable as acquaintance well said anne i certainly am proud too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place i love your indignation said he i tis very natural bu there you are in ba than d the object is to be established here wit hall the credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir w alter elliot you talk of being proud i am called proud i know and i shall not wish to believe myself otherwise for our pride if in ve st i gate d would have the same object i have no doubt thought he kind may seem a little different i none point i am sure my dear cousin he continued speaking lower thought here was no one else in t hero omi none point i am sure we must feel alike we must feel that every addition to your fathers society among his equals or superior s may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him he looked a she spoke to these at which mrs c lay had been lately occupy ing a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant and though anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride shew as pleased with him for not liking mrs c lay and her conscience admitted t ha this wishing to promote her fathers getting great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeat ing her chapter while sir w alter and elizabeth were as siduou sly pushing their good fortune in la ura place anne was renewing an acquaintance of a very different description she had called on her former governess and had heard from hero f there being an old school fellow in bath who had the two strong claims on her attention of past kindness and present suffering miss h am il to n now mrs smith had shewn her kindness i none of those periods of her life when it had been most valuable anne had gone unhappy to school griev ing forth e loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved feeling her separation from ho mean d suffering as a girl of fourteen of strong sensibility and not high spirits must suffer at such at i mean d miss h am il to n three years older than herself but still from the want of near relations and a settled home remaining another year at school had been useful and good to her in away which had considerably lessened her misery and could never be remembered with indifference miss h am il to n had left school had married not long afterwards was said to have married a man of fortune and this was all that anne had known of her till now that their governess s account brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different forms he was a widow and poor her husband had been extravagant and a this death about two years before had lef this affairs dreadfully involved she had had difficulties of every sort to contend wi than d in addition to these distresses had been afflicted with a severe rheumatic fever which final ly settling in her leg s had made her forth e present acripple she had come to bath on that account and wa snow in lodgings n earth e hot bath s living in a very humble way unable event o afford herself the comfort of a servant and of course almost excluded from society their mutual friend answered forth e satisfaction which a visit from miss elliot would give mrs smith and anne therefore lost no time in goings he mentioned nothing of what she had heard or what she intended at home it would excite no proper interest there she only consulted lady r us sell who entered thoroughly into her sentiments and was most happy to convey her as near tom rs smiths lodgings in west gate building s as anne chose to be taken the visit was paid their acquaintance re established their interest in each other more than re kindled the first ten minutes had its awkwardness and its emotion twelve years were gone since they had parted and each presented a somewhat different person from what the other had imagined twelve years had changed anne from the blooming silent un formed girl off if te en to the elegant little woman of seven and twenty with every beauty except bloom and with manners as consciously right as they were in variably gentle and twelve years had t ran s formed the fine looking well grown miss h am il to n in all the glow of health and confidence of superiority into a poor in firm helpless widow receiving the visit of her former protegee as a favour bu tall that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon passed away and left only the interesting charm of remembering former partial i ties and talking over old times anne found in mrs smith the good sense and agreeable manners which she had almost ventured to depend on and a disposition to converse and be cheerful beyond her expectation neither the dissipation soft he pa stands he had lived very much in the world nor there strict i on soft he present neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her heart or ruined her spirits in the course of a second visits he talked with great openness and anne s astonishment increased she could scarcely imagine a more cheerless situation in itself than mrs smiths she had been very fond of her husbands he had buried him she had been used to afflu en ce it was g ones he had no child to connect her with life and happiness again no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs no health to make all there st support able her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour and a dark bed room behind with no possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance which there was only one servant in the house to afford and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath yet in spite o fall this anne had reason to believe that she had moments only of languor and depression to hours of occupation and enjoyment how could it be she watched observed reflected and final ly determined that this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only a submissive spirit might be patient a strong understanding would supply resolution bu there was something more here was t hate last ic it y of mind that disposition to be comforted that power of turning readily from evil to good and of finding employment which carried hero u to f herself which was from nature alone it was the choice st g if to f heaven and anne viewed her friend a son e of those instances in which by am erc if u la p point men t it seems design ed to counter balance almost every other want there had been a time mrs smith told her when her spirits had nearly failed she could not call herself an invalid now compared with her state on first reaching bath then she had indeed been a pitiable object for she had caught cold on the journey and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before shew as again confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain and all this among strangers with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse and f in an ce sat that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expenses he had weather ed it however and could truly say that it had done her good it had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to being ood hands she had seen too much of the world to expect sudden or disinterested attachment anywhere but her illness had proved to her that her land lady had a character to preserve and would not use her il lands he had been particularly fortunate in her nurse as a sister of her land lady a nurse by profession and who had always a home in that house when unemployed chance d to beat liberty just in time to attend her and she said mrs smith besides nur sing me most admirably has really proved an invaluable acquaintance as soon as i could use my hands she taught met o knit which has been a great amusement and she put me in the way of making these little th read cases p in c us hi on s and card rack s which you always find me so busy about and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood she had a large acquaintance of course professional ly among those who can afford to buy and she dispose s of my me rc hand is e she always takes the right time for applying every body s heart is open you know when they have recently escaped from severe pain or are recovering the blessing of health and nurse rooke thoroughly understands when to speaks he i sash re wd intelligent sensible woman hers is a line for seeing human nature and she has afun do f good sense and observation which as a companion make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received the best education in the world know nothing worth attending to call it gossip if you will but when nurse rooke has half an hours leisure to bestow on me she is sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable something that makes one know ones species better one likes to hear what is going on to beau fa it as to then e west modes of being trifling and silly tom e who lives o much alone her conversation i assure you is a treat anne far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure replied i can easily believe it women of that class have great opportunities and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing and i tis not merely in its follies that they are well read forth ey see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting what instances must pass before them of ardent disinterested self denying attachment of heroism fortitude patience resignation o fall the c on flicts and all the sacrifices t hate n noble us most a sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volume s yes said mrs smith more doubtingly sometimes it may though i fear its lessons are not of te ninth e elevate d style you describe here and there human nature may be great in times of trial but generally speaking i tis its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber i tis selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude that one hears of there is so little real friendship in the world and unfortunately speaking lo wan d tremulous ly there are so many who forget to think seriously till i tis almost too late anne saw the misery of such feelings the husband had not been what he ought and the wife had been led among that part of man kind which made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved it was but a passing emotion however with mrs smiths he shook it off and soon added in a different tone i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs rookei sin at present will furnish much either to interest o red if y me she is only nur sing mrs wallis of ma rlbo rough building same re pretty silly ex pensive fashionable woman i believe and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery i meant o make my profit of mrs wallis however she has plenty of money and i intends he shall buy all the high price d things i have in hand now anne had called several times on her friend before the existence of such a person was known in c am d en place at last it became necessary to speak of hers irw alter elizabeth and mrs c lay returned one morning from la ura place with a sudden invitation from lady d al rymple forth e same evening and anne was already engaged to spend that evening in west gate building s shew as not sorry forth e excuse they were only asked shew assure because lady d al rymple being kept at home by a bad cold was glad to make use of the relations hip which had been so pressed on her and she declined on hero wn account with great alacrity shew as engaged to spend the evening wi than old school fellow they were not much interested in anything relative to anne but still there were questions enough asked to make it understood what this old school fellow was and elizabeth was disdain fu lands irw alter severe west gate building s said he and who is miss anne elliot to be visiting in west gate building sa mrs smith a widow mrs smith and w how a she r husband one of five thousand mr smiths whose names are to be met with everywhere and what i she r attraction that she i sold and sickly upon my word miss anne elliot you have them o st extraordinary taste every thing that revolts other people low company p al try rooms foul air disgusting associations are inviting to you but surely you may put off this old lady till to morrows he is not so near here ndi presume but that she may hope to see another day what i she r age forty no sir she is no tone and thirty but i do not think i can put off my engagement because i tis the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself she goes into the warm bath to morrow and forth e rest of the week you know wear e engaged but what does lady r us sell think of this acquaintance asked elizabeth she sees nothing to blame in it replied anne on the contrary she approves it and has generally taken me when i have called on mrs smith west gate building s must have been rather surprise d by the appearance of a carriage drawn up near its pave men t observed sir w alter sir henry r us sell s widow indeed has no honours to distinguish her arms but still i tis a handsome equi page and no doubt i swell known to convey amiss elliota widow mrs smith lodg ing in west gate building sa poor widow barely able t olive between thirty and forty a mere mrs smith an everyday mrs smith o fall people and all names in the world to be the chosen friend of miss anne elliot and to be preferred by her to hero wn family connect i on s among the nobility of england and ireland mrs smiths uc ha name mrs c lay who had been present while all this passed now thought it advisable to leave t hero om and anne could have said much and did long to say a little in defence of her friends not very d is similar claims to theirs but her sense of personal respect to her father prevented hers he made no reply she left it to himself to recollect that mrs smith was not the only widow in bath between thirty and forty with little t olive on and no sur name of dignity anne kept her ap point men t the others kept theirs and of courses he heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evenings he had been the only one of these t absent for sir w alter and elizabeth had not only been quite at her lady ships service themselves but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others and had been at the trouble of inviting both lady r us sell and m re lliot and m re lliot had made a point of leaving colonel wallis early and lady r us sell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait on her anne had the whole history o fall that such an evening could supply from lady r us sell to her its greatest interest must be in having been very much talked of between her friend and m re lliot in having been wished for regretted and at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause her kind compassionate visits to this old school fellows ick and red uced seemed to have quite delighted m re llio the thought her a most extraordinary young woman in her temper manners mind a model of female excellence he could meet even lady r us sell in a discussion of her merits and anne could not be given to understands o much by her friend could not know herself to be so highly rate d by a sensible man without many of those agreeable sensations which her friend meant to create lady r us sell wa snow perfectly decided in her opinion of m re lliot shew as as much convinced of his meaning to gain anne in time as of his deserving her and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widow hood and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing she would not speak to anne with half the certainty she f elton the subjects he would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter of a possible attachment on his side of the desirableness of the alliances up po sing such attachment to be real and returned anne heard her and made no violent exclamation s she only smiled blushed and gently shook her head i am no match make r as you well knows aid lady r us sell being much too well aware of the uncertainty o fall humane vent s and calculation si only meant hat if m re lliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you and if you should be disposed to accept him i think there would be every possibility of your being happy together a most suitable connect i on every body must consider it but i think it might be a very happy one m re llio tis an exceedingly agreeable man and in many respects i think highly of him said anne but we should not suit lady r us sell let this pass and only said in re join de ri own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of kellynch the future lady elliot to look forward and see you occupy ing your dear m others place succeeding to all her rights and all her popularity a swell as to all her virtues would be the highest possible gratification tom e you are your m others self in countenance and disposition and if i might be allowed to fancy you such as shew a sin situation and name and home presiding and blessing in the same spot and only superior to her in being more highly valued my dearest anne it would give me more delight than i soften felt at my time of life anne was obliged to turn away to rise to walk to a distant table and leaning there in pretended employment try to sub due the feelings this picture excited for a few moments her imagination and her heart were be wit c he d the idea of becoming what her mother had been of having the precious name of lady elliot first revived in herself of being restored to kellynch calling it her home again her home forever was a charm which she could not immediately resist lady r us sell said not another word willing to leave the matter to its own operation and believing that could m re lliot at that moment with propriety have spoken for himself she believed in short what anne did not believe the same image of m re lliot speaking for himself brought anne to composure again the charm of kellync hand of lady ellio tall fa de da ways he never could accept him and it was not only that her feelings were still ad verse to any man save one her judge men to na serious consideration of the possibilities of such a case was against m re lliot thought he y had now been acquainted a months he could not be satisfied that she really knew his character that he was a sensible man an agreeable man that he talked well professed good opinions seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle this was all clear enough he certainly knew what was right nor could she fix on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed but yet she would have been afraid to answer for his conduct she distrusted the past if not the present the names which occasionally dropt of former associates the allusions to former practice s and pursuits suggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been she saw that there had been bad habits that sunday travelling had been a common thing that there had been a period of his life and probably not a short one when he had been at least careless in all serious matters and though he might now think very differently who could answer forth e true sentiments of a clever cautious man grown old e nought o appreciate a fair character how could it ever be ascertain edt ha this mind was truly clean se dm re lliot was rational discreet polish ed but he was not open there was never any burst of feeling any warmth of indignation or delight at the evil or good of others this to anne was a decided imperfection her early impression s were in cur able she prized the frank the open hearted the eager character beyond all others warmth and en thus i as m did c apt iv ate her still she felt that she could so much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked or said a careless or a hasty thing than of those whose presence of mind never varied whose tongue never s lip pedm re lliot was too generally agreeable various as were the tempers in her fathers house he pleased them all he endured too well stood too well with every body he had spoken to her with some degree of openness of mrs c lay had appeared completely to see what mrs c lay was about and to hold her in c on tempt and yet mrs c lay found him as agreeable as any body lady r us sell saw either less or more than her young friend for she saw nothing to excite distrust she could not imagine a man more exactly what he ought to be than m re lliot nor did she ever enjoy a sweet er feeling than the hope of seeing him receive the hand of her beloved anne in kellynch church in the course of the following autumn chapter it was the beginning of february and anne having been a month in bath was growing very eager for news from upper cross and ly me she wanted to hear much more than ma ry had communicated it was three weeks since she had heard a tall she only knew t ha then rietta was at home again and that lou is a though considered to be recovering fast was still in ly mean d shew as thinking of them all very intently one evening when a thick er letter than usual from ma ry was delivered to her and to quicken the pleasure and surprise with admira land mrs cr of ts compliments the cr of ts must be in bath a circumstance to interest her they were people whom her heart turned to very naturally what is this cried sir w alter the cr of ts have arrived in bath the cr of ts who r en tkellynch what have they brought you a letter from upper cross cottage sir oh those letters are convenient p as sports they secure an introduction i should have visited admir al cr of t however at any rate i know what is due tom y ten an t anne could listen no longer she could note v en have told how the poor admir al s complexion escaped her letter engrossed her it had been begun several days back february my dear anne i make no apology form y silence because i know how little people think of letters in such a place as bath you must be a great dealt oo happy to care for upper cross which as you well know affords little to write about we have had a very dull christmas mr and mrs m us grove have not ha done dinner party all the holidays i do not reckon the hay ters as any body the holidays however are over at last i believe no children ever had such long ones i am sure i had not the house was cleared yesterday except of the little ha rv ill es but you will be surprise d to h earth ey have never gone home mrs ha rv ill e must be an odd mother to part with t hems o long i do not understand it they are not a tall nice children in my opinion but mrs m us grove seems to like them quite a swell if not better than her grand children what dreadful weather we have had it may not be felt in bath with your nice pave men ts but in the country i tis of some consequence i have not had a creature call on me since the second week in january except c ha rles hay ter who had been calling much oftener than was welcome between ourselves i think it a great pity h en rietta did not remain at ly me as long as lou is a it would have kept her a little out of his way the carriage is gone to day to bring lou is a and the ha r vi l lest o morrow wear e not asked to dine with them however till the day after mrs m us grove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey which is not very likely considering the care that will be taken of her and it would be much more convenient to met o dine there to morrow i am glad you find m re lliot so agreeable and wish i could be acquainted with him too but i have my usual luck i am always out of the way when anything desirable is going on always the last of my family to be noticed what an immense time mrs c lay has been staying with elizabeth does she never meant o go away but perhaps if she were to leave t hero om vacant we might not be invited let me know what you think of this i do not expect my children to be asked you know i can leave them at the great ho us every well for a month or six weeks i have this moment heard that the cr of ts are going to bath almost immediately they think t head mir al gout yc ha rles heard it quite by chance they have not had the civility to give mean y notice or of offering to take anything i do not think they improve a tall as neighbours we see nothing of them and this is really an instance of gross in attention c ha rles join s me in love and every thing proper yours affectionately ma rymi am sorry to say that i am very far from well and j em i ma has just told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore throat very much about i dares ayi shall catch it and my sore throats you k no ware always worse than any body s so ended the first part which had been afterwards put into an en velope containing nearly as much more i kept my letter o pent hat i might send you word how lou is a bore her journey and now i am extremely glad i did having a great dealt oad dint he first place i had a note from mrs cr of t yesterday offering to convey anything to you a very kind friendly note indeed addressed tom e just a sit ought i shall therefore be able to make my letter as long as i like t head mir al does not seem very il land i sincerely hope bath will do him all the good he wants i shall be truly glad to have them back again our neighbourhood cannot spare such a pleasant family but now for lou is ai have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little she and the ha rv ill es came on tuesday very safely an dint he evening we went to ask her hows he did when we were rather surprise d not to find captain b en wick of the party for he had been invited a swell as the ha rv ill es and what do you think was the reason neither more nor less than his being in love with lou is a and notch oo sing to venture to upper cros still he had had an answer from mr m us grove for it was all settled between him and her before she came away and he had written to her father by captain ha rv ill e true upon my honour are not you astonished i shall be surprise d at least if you ever received a hint o fit for i never did mrs m us grove protest s solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter wear e all very well pleased however for though i tis not equal to her marrying captain went worth i tis infinitely better than c ha rles hay ter and mr m us grove has written his consent and captain b en wick is expected to day mrs ha rv ill e says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sisters account but however lou is a is a great favourite with both indeed mrs ha rv ill e and i quite agree that we love her the better for having nursed her c ha rles wonders what captain went worth will say but if you remember i never thought him attached to lou is ai never could see anything o fit and this is the end you see of captain b en wicks being supposed to be an admirer of yours how c ha rles could takes uc ha thing into his head was always incomprehensible tom ei hope he will be more agreeable now certainly not a great match for lou is am us grove but a million times better than marrying among the hay ters ma ry need not have feared her sisters being in any degree prepared forth e news she had never in her life been more astonished captain b en wick and lou is am us grove it was almost too wonderful for belief and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain in t hero om preserve an air of calmness and answer the common questions of the moment happily for her they were not many sir w alter wanted to know whether the cr of ts travelled with four horses and whether they were likely to be situated in such apart of bath a sit might suit miss elliot and himself to visit in but had little curiosity beyond how is ma ry said elizabeth and without waiting for an answer and pray what brings the cr of ts to bath they come on t head mir al s account he is thought to be gout y gout and de c re p it u de s aids irw alter poor old gentleman have they any acquaintance here asked elizabeth i do not know but i can hardly suppose that at admir al cr of ts time of life and in his profession he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this i suspect s aids irw alter coolly that admir al cr of t will be best known in bath as t her enter of kellynch hall elizabeth may we venture to present him and his wife in la ura place oh no i think not situated as wear e with lady d al rymple cousins we ought to b every careful not to em bar r as she r with acquaintance she might not approve if we were not related it would not signify but as cousins she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal o four s we had better leave the cr of ts to find their own level there are several odd looking men walking about here who i am to l dares ail or s the cr of ts will associate with them this was sir w alter and elizabeth s share of interest in the letter when mrs c lay had paid her tribute of more decent attention in an en quiry after mrs c ha rlesm us grove and her fine little boys anne was at liberty in hero wn rooms he tried to comprehend it well might c ha rles wonder how captain went worth would feel perhaps he had quitted the field had given lou is a up had ceased to love had found he did not love hers he could not endure the idea of treachery or levity or anything ak into ill usage between him and his friends he could not endure that such a friendship as theirs should be severe dun fairly captain b en wick and lou is am us grove the high spirited joyous talking lou is am us grove and the de jected thinking feeling reading captain b en wick seemed each of them every thing that would not suit the other their minds most d is similar where could have been the attraction the answers o on presented itself it had been in situation they had been thrown together several weeks they had been living in the same small family party since h en riett as coming away they must have been depending almost entirely on each other and lou is a just recovering from illness had been in an interesting state and captain b en wick was not in c on so l able that was a point which anne had not be enable to avoid suspecting before and instead of drawing the same conclusion as ma ry from the present course of events they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some dawn ing of tenderness to war d herself she did not mean however to de r iv e much more from it to gratify her vanity than ma ry might have allowed shew as persuaded that any tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have received the same compliment he had an affectionate h earth e must love somebody she saw no reason against their being happy lou is a had fine nav al fervour to begin wi than d they would soon grow more alike he would gain cheerfulness and she would learnt o be an en thus i as t for scott and lord by r on nay that was probably learnt already of course they had fallen in love over poet ry the idea of lou is am us grove turned into a person of literary taste and sentiment al reflection was amusing but she had no doubt o fits beings o the day at ly met he fall from the cobb might influence her health her nerves her courage her character to the end of her life as thoroughly a sit appeared to have influenced her fate the conclusion of the whole was that if the woman who had been sensible of captain went worth s merits could be allowed to prefer another man there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder and if captain went worth lost no friend by it certainly nothing to be regretted no it was not regret which made anne s heart beat in spite of herself and brought the colour into her cheeks when she thought of captain went worth uns ha ck led and free she had some feelings which shew as ashamed to in ve st i gate they were too much like joy senseless joy she longed to see the cr of ts but when the meeting took place it was evident that no rumour of then ews had yet reached them the visit of ceremony was paid and returned and lou is am us grove was mentioned and captain b en wick too without even half a smile the cr of ts had placed themselves in lodgings in gay street perfectly to sir w alter s satisfaction he was not a tall ashamed of the acquaintance and did in fact think and talk a great deal more about t head mir al than t head mir al ever thought or talked about him the cr of ts knew quite as many people in bath as they wished for and considered their intercourse with the elliotsa same re matter of form and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure they brought with them their country habit of being almost always together he was ordered to walk to keep off the gout and mrs cr of t seemed to go share s with him in every thing and to walk for her life to do him good anne saw them wherever she went lady r us sell took hero ut in her carriage almost every morning and she never failed to think of them and never failed to see them knowing their feelings as she did it was a most attractive picture of happiness to hers he always watched them as long as she could delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of as they walked along in happy independence or equally delighted to see t head mir al s hearty shake of the hand when he encountered an old friend and observe their eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into a little k not of then avy mrs cr of t looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officer s around her anne was too much engaged with lady r us sell to be often walking herself but its o happened that one morning about a week or ten days after the cr of ts arrival it suited her best to leave her friend or her friends carriage in the lower part of the town and return alone to c am d en place and in walking up mil so m streets he had the good fortune to meet with t head mir al he was standing by himself at apr in t shop window with his hands behind him in earnest contemplation of some pr in t and she not only might have passed him unseen but was obliged to touch a swell as address him before she could catch his notice when he did perceive and acknowledge her

e always meeting with some old friend or other the streets full of them every mornings u re to have plenty of chat and then we get away from them al lands hut ourselves in our lodgings and draw in our chair s an dares nug as if we were at kellync hay or as we used to be even at north yar mouth and deal we do not like our lodgings here the worse i can tell you for putting u sin mind of those we first had at north yar mouth the wind blow s through one of the c up boards just in the same way when they were got a little farther anne ventured to press again for what he had to communicate she hoped when clear of mil so m street to have her curiosity gratified but shew as still obliged to wait forth eadmir al had made up his mind not to begin till they had gained the greater space and quiet of be lm on t and as shew as not really mrs cr of t she must let him have his own way as soon as they were fairly ascending be l month e began well now you shall hear something that will surprise you but first o fall you must tell me then am e of the young lady i am going total k about that young lady you know that we have all been so concerned forth e miss m us grove t ha tall this has been happening to her christian name i always forget her christian name anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really did but now she could safely suggest then am e of lou is aayay miss lou is am us grove that is then am ei wish young ladies had not such a number of fine christian names i should never be out if they were all so phy so r something of that sort well this miss loui saw e all thought you know was to marry f red erick he was court ing her week after week the only wonder was what they could be waiting for till the business at ly me came then indeed it was clear e nought hat they must wait till her brain was set to right but event h en there was something odd in their way of going on instead of staying at ly me he went off top ly mouth and then he went off to see ed war d when we came back from mine head he was gone down to ed war ds and there he has be e never since we have seen nothing of him since november even so phy could not understand it but now the matter ha stake the strangest turn o fall forth is young lady the same miss m us grove instead of being to marry f red erick is to marry james b en wick you know james b en wicka little i am a little acquainted with captain b en wick well she is to marry him nay most likely they are married already for i do not know what they should wait for i thought captain b en wicka very pleasing young man said anne and i understand that he bears an excellent character oh yes yes there is not a word to be said against james b en wick he is only a command eri tis true made last summer and these are bad times forgetting on but he has not another fault that i know of an excellent good hearted fellow i assure you a very active zeal o us officer too which is more than you would think for perhaps forth at soft sort of manner does not do him justice indeed you are mistaken there sir i should never augur want of spirit from captain b en wicks manners i thought them particularly pleasing and i will answer for it they would generally please well well ladies are the best judges but james b en wick is rather too pi an o for mean d though very likely i tis all our partiality so phy and i cannot help thinking f red ericks manners better than his there is something about f red erick more to our taste anne was caught she had only meant to oppose the too common idea of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other not a tall to represent captain b en wicks manners as th every best that could possibly be and after a little hesitations he was beginning to say i was not entering into any comparison of the two friends but t head mir al interrupted her wi than d the thing is certainly true i tis not a mere bit of gossip we have it from f red erick himself his sister had a letter from him yesterday in which he tells us o fit and he had just had it in a letter from ha rv ill e written upon the spot from upper cross i fancy they a real l at upper cross this was an opportunity which anne could not resist she said therefore i hope admir al i hope there is nothing in the style of captain went worth s letter to make you and mrs cr of t particularly uneasy it did seem last autumn as if there were an attachment between him and lou is am us grove but i hope it may be understood to have worn out on each side equally and without violence i hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill used man not a tall not a tall there is not an oath or am urmur from beginning to end anne looked down to hid e her smile non of red erick is not a man to wh in e and complain he has too much spirit forth at if the girl likes another man better i tis very fits he should have him certainly but what i mean is that i hope there is nothing in captain went worth s manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks himself ill used by his friend which might appear you know without its being absolutely said i should b every sorry that such a friendship as has subs is ted between him and captain b en wick should be destroyed or even wounded by a circumstance of this sort yes yes i understand you but there is nothing a tall of that nature in the letter he does not give the least fling at b en wick does not so much as say i wonder at it i have a reason of my own for wondering at it no you would not guess from his way of writing that he had ever thought of this miss what she r name for himself h every handsomely hopes they will be happy together and there is nothing very un forgiving in that i think anne did not receive the perfect conviction which t head mir al meant to convey but it would have been useless to press the en quiry farther she therefore satisfied herself with commonplace remarks or quiet attention and t head mir al had i tall his own way poor f red erick said heat last now he must begin al lover again with somebody else i think we must get him to bath so phy must write and beg him to come to bath here are pretty girls enough i am sure it would be of no u set o got o upper cross again forth at other miss m us grove i find is be spoke by her cousin the young par son do not you think miss elliot we had better try to get him to bath chapter while admir al cr of t was taking this walk wi than ne and expressing his wish of getting captain went worth to bath captain went worth was already on his way thither before mrs cr of t had written he was arrived and th every next ti mean ne walked out she sa whim m re lliot was attending his two cousins and mrs c lay they were in mil so m street it began to rain not much but e nought o make shelter desirable for women and quite e nought o make it very desirable for miss elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in lady d al rymples carriage which was seen waiting at a little distance she anne and mrs c lay therefore turned into mol lands while m re lliot step ped to lady d al rymp let o request her assistance he soon joined them again successful of course lady d al rymple would be most happy to take them ho mean d would call forth em in a few minutes her lady ships carriage was a barouche and did not hold more than four wi than y comfort miss carte re t was with her mother consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation for all the three c am d en place ladies there could b en o doubt as to miss elliot whoever suffered inconveniences he must suffer none but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility between the other tw other a in wa same re trifle and anne was most sincere in p referring a walk with m re lliot but the rain was also a mere trifle tom rsc lay she would hardly allow it event o drop a tall and her boot s were so thick much thick er than miss anne s and in short her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left to walk with m re lliot as anne could be and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so determined that the others were obliged to settle it forth em miss elliot maintaining that mrs c lay had a little cold already and m re lliot deciding on appeal t ha this cousin anne s boot s were rather the thick e st it was fixed accordingly that mrs c lay should be of the party in the carriage and they had just reached this point when anne as she sat n earth e window descried most decidedly and distinctly captain went worth walking down the street her start was perceptible only to herself but she instantly felt that shew as the greatest simpleton in the world them o st unaccountable and absurd for a few minutes she saw nothing before her it was all confusion shew as lo stand when she had scolded back her senses she found the others still waiting forth e carriage and m re lliot always obliging just setting off for union street on a commission of mrs c lay s she now felt a great inclination to got o the out er doors he wanted to see i fit rained why was she to suspect herself of another motive captain went worth must be out of sights he left her seats he would go one half of her should not be always so much wiser than the other half or always suspecting the other of being worse than it was she would see i fit rained shew assent back however in a moment by the entrance of captain went worth himself among a party of gentlemen and ladies evidently his acquaintance and whom he must have joined a little below mil so m street he was more ob vi ou sly struck and confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before he looked quite red forth e first time since their renewed acquaintance she felt that shew as betraying the least sensibility of the two she had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments all the overpowering blind ing be wild e ring first effects of strong surprise were over with her still however she had e nought o feel it was agitation pain pleasure a something between delight and misery he spoke to her and then turned away the character of his manner was embarrassment she could not have called it either cold or friendly or anything so certainly as embarrassed after a short interval however he came towards her and spoke again mutual en quirie son common subjects passed neither of them probably much the wiser for what they heard and anne continuing fully sensible of his being less at ease than formerly they had by dint of beings o very much together got to speak to each other with a considerable portion of apparent indifference and calmness but he could not do it now time had changed him or lou is a had changed him there was consciousness of some sort or other he looked very well not as if he had been suffering in health or spirits and he talked of upper cross of them us grove s nay even of lou is a and had even a momentary look of his own arch sign if i can cea she named her but yet it was captain went worth not comfortable note as y no table to feign that he was it did not surprise but it grieved anne to observe that elizabeth would not k no whims he saw that he saw elizabeth that elizabeth sa whim that there was complete internal re cogn it io none ach side shew as convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance expecting it and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away with un alter able coldness lady d al rymples carriage for which miss elliot was growing very impatient now drew up the servant came into announce it it was beginning to rain again and altogether there was a delay and a bustle and a talking which must make all the little crowd in the shop understand that lady d al rymple was calling to convey miss elliot at last miss elliot and her friend unattended but by the servant forth e re was no cousin returned were walking off and captain went worth watching them turned again to anne and by manner rather than words was offering his services to her i am much obliged to you wa she r answer but i am not going with them the carriage would not accommodate so many i walk i prefer walking but i train s oh very little nothing that i regard after a moments pause he said though i came only yesterday i have equipped myself properly for bath already you see pointing to a new umbrella i wish you would make use o fit if you are determined to walk though i think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair shew as very much obliged to him but declined i tall repeating her conviction that the rain would come to nothing at present and adding i am only waiting form re llio the will be here in a moment i am sure she had hardly spoken the words when m re lliot walked in captain went worth recollected him perfectly there was no difference between him and them an who had stood on the steps at ly me admiring anne as she passed except in the air and look and manner of the privileged relation and friend he came in with eagerness appeared to see and think only of her apologised for his stay was grieved to have kept her waiting and anxious together away without further loss of ti mean d before the rain increased and in another moment they walked off together her arm under his a gentle and embarrassed glance and a good morning to you being all that she had time for as she passed away as soon as they were out of sight the ladies of captain went worth s party began talking of them m re lliot does not dislike his cousin i fancy oh no that is clear enough one can guess what will happen there he is always with them half lives in the family i believe what a very good looking many es and miss at k in son who dined with him once at the wallises says he is them o st agreeable man she ever was in company with she is pretty i think anne elliot very pretty w he none comes to look at her i tis not the fashion to says o but i confess i admire her more than her sister oh so do i and so do in o comparison but them en a real l wild after miss elliot anne is too delicate forth em anne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin if he would have walked by hers idea ll the way to c am d en place without saying a words he had never found its o difficult to listen to him though nothing could exceed his solicitude and care and though his subjects were principally such as were w on t to be always interesting praise warm ju stand d is crim in at ing of lady r us sell and in sin u at i on s highly rational against mrs c lay but just now she could think only of captain went worth she could not understand his present feelings whether he were really suffering much from disappointment or not and till that point were settled she could not be quite herself she hoped to be wise and reasonable in time but alas alas she must confess to herself that shew as not wise yet another circumstance very essential for her to know wa show long he meant to be in bath he had not mentioned it or she could not recollect i the might be only passing through but it was more probable that he should become to stay in that cases o liable as every body was to meet every body in bath lady r us sell would in all likelihood see him somewhere would she recollect him how would i tall be she had already been obliged to tell lady r us sell that lou is am us grove was to marry captain b en wick it had cost her something to encounter lady r us sell s surprise and now if she were by any chance to be thrown into company with captain went worth her im perfect knowledge of the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him the following morning anne was out with her friend and forth e first hour in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain but at last in returning down p ult en ey streets he distinguished hi month e right hand pave men t at such a distance as to have him in view the greater part of the street there were many other men about him many group s walking the same way but there was no mis taking him she looked instinctive ly at lady r us sell but not from any mad idea of her re cogni sing him so soon as she did herself no it was not to be supposed that lady r us sell would perceive him till they were nearly opposite she looked at her however from time to time anxiously and when the moment approached which must point him out though not daring to look again for hero wn countenance she knew was unfit to be seen shew as yet perfectly conscious of lady r us sell s eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him of her being in short intently observing him she could thoroughly comprehend the sort off as c in at i on he must possess over lady r us sell s mind the difficulty it must be for her to with dr a where yes the astonishment she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him and in fo reign c limes and in active service too without robb ing him of one personal grace at last lady r us sell drew back her head now how would she speak of him you will wonders aids he what has been fixing my eyes o long but i was looking after some window curtains which lady al icia and mrs frank land were telling me of last night they described the drawing room window curtains of one of the houses on this side of the way and this part of the street as being the handsomest and best hung of any in bath but could not recollect the exact number and i have been trying to find out which it could be but i confess i can seen o curtains hereabouts that answer their description anne sighed and blushed and smiled in pity and d is dai neither at her friend or herself the part which provoked her most was that in all this waste of foresight and caution she should have lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them a day or two passed without producing anything the t heat re or the rooms where he was most likely to be were not fashionable enough forth eelliots whose evening amusement s were sole ly in the elegant stupidity of private parties in which they were getting more and more engaged and anne wearied of such a state of stagnation sick of knowing nothing and fancying herself stronger because her strength was not tried was quite impatient forth e concert evening it was a concert forth e benefit of a person p at r on is ed by lady d al rymple of course they must attend it was really expected to be a good one and captain went worth was very fond of music if she could only have a few minutes conversation with him a gains he fancied she should be satisfied and as to the power of addressing him she felt al lover courage if the opportunity occurred elizabeth had turned from him lady r us sell overlook ed him her nerves were strengthened by these circumstances she felt that she owed him attentions he had once partly promised mrs smith to spend the evening with her but in a short hurried calls he excused herself and put it off with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow mrs smith gave a most goodhumoured acquiescence by all means s aids he only tell meal l about it when you do come who is your party anne named them all mrs smith made no reply but when shew as leaving hers aid and wi than expression half serious half arch well i heartily wish your concert may answer and do not fail met o morrow if you can come for i begin to have a fore bod ing that i may not have many more visits from you anne was startled and confused but after standing in a moments suspense was obliged and not sorry to be obliged to hurry away chapters irw alter his two daughters and mrs c lay were the earliest o fall their party at the rooms in the evening and as lady d al rymple must be waited forth ey took their station by one of the fires in the oct ago n room but hardly were they so settled when the door opened again and captain went worth walked in alone anne was the nearest to him and making yet a little advances he instantly spoke he was preparing only to bow and pass on but her gentle how do you do brought him out of the st raight line to stand near her and make en quirie sin return in spite of the formidable father and sister in the background their being in the background was a support to anne she knew nothing of their looks and felt equal to every thing which she believed right to be done while they were speaking a whispering between her father and elizabeth caught here ar she could not distinguish but she must guess the subject an don captain went worth s making a distant bows he comprehended that her father had judged s owe l last o give him that simple acknowledge men to f acquaintance and shew as just in time by aside glance to see a slight curt se y from elizabeth herself this though late and reluctant and ungracious was yet better than nothing and her spirits improved after talking however of the weather and ba than d the concert their conversation began to f la g and so little was said at last that shew as expecting him to go every moment but he did not he seemed inn o hurry to leave her and presently with renewed spirit with a little smile a little glow he said i have hardly seen you since our day at ly me i am afraid you must have suffered from the shock and the more from its not overpowering you at the times he assured him that she had not it was a frightful hours aid he a frightful day and he passed hi shan d across his eyes as if the remembrance were still too painful but in a moment half smiling again added the day has produced some effects however has had some consequences which must be considered as th every reverse of frightful when you had the presence of mind to suggest that b en wick would be the properest person to fetch as urge on you could have little idea of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery certainly i could have none but it appears i should hope it would be a very happy match there are on both side s good principles and good temper yes said he looking not exactly forward but there i think ends the resemblance wit hall my soul i wish them happy and rejoice over every circumstance in favour o fit they have no difficulties to contend wi that home no opposition no caprice no delays them us grove s are behaving like themselves most honourably and kindly only anxious with true parent al hearts to promote their daughters comfort all this is much very much in favour of their happiness more than perhaps he stopped a sudden recollections e em ed to occur and to give him some taste of that emotion which was red d en ing anne s cheeks and fixing her eyes on the ground after clearing his throat however he proceeded thus i confess that i do think there is a disparity too great a disparity and in a point no less essential than mind i regard lou is am us grove as a very amiable sweet tempered girl and not deficient in understanding but b en wick is something more he is a clever man a reading man and i confess that i do consider his attaching himself to her with some surprise had it been the effect of gratitude had he learnt to love her because he believed her to be p referring him it would have been another thing but i have no reason to suppose its o it seems on the contrary to have been a perfectly spontaneous un taught feeling on his s idea nd this surprise s me a man like him in his situation with a heart pierced wounded almost broken f an ny ha rv ill e was a very superior creature and his attachment to her was indeed attachment a man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman he ought not he does not either from the consciousness however t ha this friend had recovered or fro mother consciousness he went no farther and anne who in spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered and in spite o fall the various noise soft hero om the almost ceaseless sl am of the door and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through had distinguished every word was struck gratified confused and beginning to breathe very quick and feel an hundred things in a moment it was impossible for her to enter on such a subject and yet after a pause feeling the necessity of speaking and having not the smallest wish for a total changes he only de vi ate d sofa r as to say you were a good while at ly me i think about a fortnight i could not leave it till lou is as doing well was quite ascertain edi had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to be soon at peace it had been my doings olely mine she would not have been obstinate if i had not been weak the country roundly me is very fine i walked and rode a great deal and the more i saw the more i found to admire i should very much like to see ly me a gains aid anne indeed i should not have supposed that you could have found anything in ly met o inspire such a feeling the horror and distress you were involved in the stretch of mind the wear of spirits i should have thought your last impression so fly me must have been strong disgust the last hours were certainly very painful replied anne but when pain is over the remembrance o fit often becomes a pleasure one does not love a place the less for having suffered in it unless it has been all suffering nothing but suffering which was by no means the ca seat ly me we were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours and previously there had been a great deal of enjoyments o much novelty and beauty i have travelled so little that every fresh place would be interesting tom e but there is real beauty at ly mean d in short with a faint blush at some recollections altogether my impression soft he place ar every agreeable as she ceased the entrance door opened again and th every party appeared for whom they were waiting lady d al rymple lady d al rymple was the rejoicing sound and wit hall the eagerness compatible with anxious elegance sir w alter and his two ladies step ped forward to meet her lady d al rym plea nd miss carte re t escorted by m re lliot and colonel wallis who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant advanced in t other oom the others joined them and it was a group in which anne found herself also necessarily included shew as divided from captain went worth their interesting almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time but slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on she had learnt in the last ten minutes more of his feelings towards lou is a more o fall his feelings than she dared to think of and she gave herself up to the demands of the party to then eedful civilities of the moment with exquisite though agitated sensations shew a sing ood humour wit hall she had received ideas which disposed her to be court eo us and kind to al land to pity every one as being less happy than herself the delightful emotions were a little subdued when on step p ing back from the group to be joined again by captain went worth she saw that he was g ones he was just in time to see him turn into the concert room he was gone he had d is appeared she felt a moments regret but they should meet again he would look for her he would find hero ut before the evening were over and at present perhaps it was a swell to be asunder shew a sin need of a little interval for recollection upon lady r us sell s appearances o on afterwards the whole party was collected and all that remained was tom ars ha l themselves and proceed into the concert room and be o fall the consequence in their power draw as many eyes excite as many whispers and disturb as many people as they could very very happy were both elizabeth and anne elliot as they walked in elizabeth arm in arm with miss carte re t and looking on the broad back of the do w age rv is count essd al rymple before her had nothing to wish for which did not seem within her reach and anne but it would be an insult to the nature of anne s felicity to draw any comparison between it and her sisters the origin of one all selfish vanity of the other all generous attachment anne saw nothing thought nothing of the brilliancy of t hero om her happiness was from within her eyes were bright and her cheeks glow ed but she knew nothing about it shew as thinking only of the last half hour and as they passed to theirs eats her mind took a hasty range over i this choice of subjects his expressions and still more his manner and look had been such as she could see in only one light his opinion of lou is am us grove s inferiority an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give his wonder at captain b en wick his feelings as to a first strong attachments en ten ces begun which he could not finish his half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance all all declared that he had a heart returning to her at least that anger resentment avoi dance were no more and that they were succeeded not merely by friendship and regard but by the tenderness of the past yes some share of the tenderness of the past she could not contemplate the change a simply ing less he must love her these were thoughts with their attendant vision s which occupied and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation and she passed along t hero om without having a glimpse of him without even trying to discern him when their places were determined on and they were all properly arranged she looked round to see if he should happen to be in the same part of t hero om but he was no there ye could not reach him and the concert being just opening she must consent for a time to be happy in a humble r way the party was divided and disposed of on two c on tiguo us bench es anne was among those on the fore mo stand m re lliot had man oeuv red so well with the assistance of his friend colonel wallis as to have a seat by her miss elliot surrounded by her cousins and the principal object of colonel wallis s gallantry was quite contented anne s mind was in a most favourable state forth e entertainment of the evening it was just occupation enough she had feelings forth e tender spirits forth e gay attention forth esci en t if i can d patience forth e wear is o mean d had never liked a concert better at least during the first act towards the close o fit in the interval succeeding an italian songs he explained the words of the song tom re lliot they had a concert b ill between them this s aids he is nearly the sense or rather the meaning of the words for certainly the sense of an italian loves on g must not be talked of but i tis as nearly the meaning as i can give for i do not pretend to understand the language i am a very poor italian scholar yes yes i see you are i see you know nothing of the matter you have only knowledge enough of the language to t ran s late at sight these in

politeness but i should be sorry to be examined by a real pr of ici en ti have not had the pleasure of visiting in c am d en places o long replied he without knowing something of miss anne ellio tan did o regard her a son e who is too modest forth e world in general to be aware of half her accomplishments and too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in any other woman for shame for shame this is too much flattery i forget what wear e to have next turning to the b ill perhaps said m re lliot speaking low i have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of indeed hows o you can have been acquainted with it only since i came to bath excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my own family i knew you by report long before you came to bath i had heard you described by those who knew you intimately i have been acquainted with you by character many years your person your disposition accomplishments manner they were all present tom em re lliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise no one can with stand the charm of such a mystery to have been described long a got oa recent acquaintance by name less people is irresistible and anne was all curiosity she wondered and questioned him eagerly but in vain he delighted in being asked but he would not tell non o some time or other perhaps but not now he would mention no names now but such he could assure her had been the fact he had many years ago received such a description of miss anne elliot as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit and excited the warmest curiosity to know her anne could think of no ones o likely to have spoken with partiality of her many years ago as them r went worth of m on k ford captain went worth s brother he might have been in m re lliots company but she had not courage to ask the question then am e of anne elliot said he has long had an interesting sound tom every long has it possessed a charm over my fancy and if i dared i would breathe my wishes that then am e might never changes uch she believed were his words but scarcely had she received theirs ound than her attention was caught by others ounds immediately behind her which rendered every thing else trivial her father and lady d al rymple were speaking a well looking man s aids irw alter a very well looking man a very fine young man indeed said lady d al rymple more air t ha none often sees in bath irish i dares ay no i just know his name ab owing acquaintance went worth captain went worth of then avy his sister married my ten an t in some r sets hi re the cr of t who r en tskellynch before sir w alter had reached this point anne s eyes had caught the right direction and distinguished captain went worth standing among acl us ter of men at a little distance a she r eyes fell on him his seemed to be withdrawn from her it had that appearance it seemed as if she had be e none moment too late and as long as she dared observe he did not look again but the performance was re com men c ing and shew as forced to seem to restore her attention to the or c he st ra and look straightforward when she could give another glance he had moved away he could not have come nearer to her if he would shew as so surrounded and shut in but she would rather have caught his eye m re lliots speech too distressed hers he had no longer any inclination total k to him she wished him not so near her the first act was over now she hoped for some b en efici al change and after a period of nothing saying amongst the party some of them did decide on going in quest of tea anne wa son e of the few who did not choose to moves he remained in hers eat and so did lady r us sell but she had the pleasure of getting rid of m re lliot and she did not mean whatever she might feel on lady r us sell s account to shr in k from conversation with captain went worth if he gave her the opportunity shew as persuaded by lady r us sell s countenance that she had seen him he did not come however anne sometimes fancied she discerned him at a distance but he never came the anxious interval wore away un productive ly the others returned t hero om filled again bench es were re claimed and re possessed and another hour of pleasure or of penance was to be sat out another hour of music was to give delight or the gapes as real or affected taste for it prevailed to anne it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation she could not quit that room in peace without seeing captain went worth once more without the interchange of one friendly look in re settling themselves there were now many changes the result of which was favourable for her colonel wallis declined sitting down again and m re lliot was invited by elizabeth and miss carte re t in a manner not to be refused to sit between them and by some other removal s and a little sch em ing of hero wn anne was enabled to place herself much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before much more within reach of a pass er by she could not do so without comparing herself with miss la rol lest he inimitable miss la rolles but still she did it and not with much happier effect though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of a nearly abdic at i on in her next neighbours she found herself at th every end of the bench before the concert closed such wa she r situation with a vacant space a than d when captain went worth was again insight she sa whim not far off he saw her too yet he looked grave and seemed irresolute and only by very slow degree sca meat last near e nought o speak to hers he felt that something must be the matter the change was indubitable the difference between his present air and what it had be e ninth eoct ago n room was strikingly great why was it she thought of her father of lady r us sell could there have been any unpleasant glances he began by speaking of the concert gravely more like the captain went worth of upper cross owned himself disappointed had expected singing and in short must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over anne replied and spoke in defence of the performances o well and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly t ha this countenance improved and he replied again with almost a smile they talked for a few minutes more the improvement held he even looked down towards the bench as if he saw a place on it well worth occupy ing when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged anne to turn round it came from m re llio the begged her pardon but she must be applied to to explain italian again miss carte re t was very anxious to have a general idea of what was next to be sung anne could not refuse but never had she sacrifice d to politeness with a more sufferings pir it a few minutes though as few as possible were inevitably c on su me d and when hero wn mistress again wh enable to turn and look as she had done before she found herself accosted by captain went worth in a reserved yet hurried sort of fare well he must wish her good night he was going he should get home as fast a she could is not this song worth staying for said anne suddenly struck by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging no he replied im press iv ely there is nothing worth my staying for and he was gone directly jealousy of m re lliot it was the only intelligible motive captain went worth jealous of her affection could she have believed it a week ago three hours ago for a moment the gratification was exquisite but alas there we r every different thoughts to succeed how was such jealousy to be quiet ed how was the truth to reach him ho win all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations would he ever learn of her real sentiments it was misery to think of m re lliots attentions their evil was in c al cul able chapter anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going tom rs smith meaning that it should engage her from ho meat the time when m re lliot would be most likely to call for to avoid m re lliot was almost a first objects he felt a great deal of goodwill towards him in spite of the mischief of his attentions she owed him gratitude and regard perhaps compassion she could not help thinking much of the extraordinary circumstances attending their acquaintance of the right which he seemed to have to interest her by every thing in situation by his own sentiments by his early prepossession it was altogether very extraordinary flattering but painful there was much to regret hows he might have felt had there been no captain went worth in the case was not worth en quiry forth e re was a captain went worth and be the conclusion of the presents us pen se good or bad her affection would be his forever their union she believed could not divide her more fro mother men than their final separation pre t tie r musing s of high w rough t love and eternal constancy could never have passed along the streets of bath than anne was sport ing with from c am d

obliged to her for coming seemed hardly to have expected her though it had been an ap point men tan account of the concert was immediately claimed and anne s recollections of the concert were quite happy e nought o an im ate her features and make her rejoice total k of i tall that she could tells he told most gladly but t heal l was little for o new ho had been there and un satisfactory for such an en qui re r as mrs smith who had already heard through the short cut of al aun dress and a wait er rather more of the general success and produce of the evening than anne could relate and who now asked in vain for several particulars of the company every body of any consequence or not or iety in bath wa swell know by name tom rs smith the little dur and s were there i conclude s aids he with their mouth so pent o catch the music like unf led gedsp arrow s ready to be fed they never miss a concert yes i did not see them myself but i heard m re lliot say they were in t hero om the ibbot sons were they there and the two new beauties with the tall irish officer who is talked of for one of them i do not know i do not think they were old lady ma ry ma clean i need not ask after hers he never misses i know and you must have seen hers he must have been in your own circle for as you went with lady d al rymple you were in these at s of grandeur round the or c he st ra of course no that was what i dreaded it would have been very unpleasant tom e in every respect but happily lady d al rymple always choose s to be farther off and we were exceedingly well placed that is for hearing i must not say for seeing because i appear to have seen very little oh you saw enough for your own amusement i can understand there is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd and this you had you were a large party in y ourselves and you wanted nothing beyond but i ought to have looked about me more said anne conscious while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about that the object only had been deficient non o you were better employed you need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening i see it in your eye i perfectly see how the hours passed that you had always something agreeable to listen to in the intervals of the concert it was conversation anne half smiled and said do you see that in m ye y eyes i do your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think them o st agreeable in the world the person who interests you at this present time more than all there s to f the world put together a blush over spread anne s cheeks she could say nothing and such being the case continued mrs smith after a short pause i hope you believe that i do know how to value your kindness in coming tom e this morning i tis really very good of y out oco mean d sit with me when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your ti mean ne heard nothing of this shew as still in the astonishment and confusion excited by her friends penetration unable to imagine ho wan y report of captain went worth could have reached her after another short silence pray said mrs smith is m re lliot aware of your acquaintance with me does he know that i am in bath m re lliot repeated anne looking up surprise da moments reflections he we d her the mistakes he had been under she caught it instantaneous ly and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety soon added more composedly are you acquainted with m re llioti have been a good deal acquainted with him replied mrs smith gravely but it seems worn out no wit is a great while since we met i was not a tall aware of this you never mentioned it before had i known it i would have had the pleasure of talking to him about y out o confess the truths aid mrs smith assuming her usual air of cheerfulness that is exactly the pleasure i want y out o have i want you total k about met om re llioti want your interest with him he can be of essential service to mean d if you would have the goodness my dear miss elliot to make i tan object to yourself of course i tis done i should be extremely happy i hope you cannot doubt my willing ness to be of event he slightest u set o you replied anne but i suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on m re lliota greater right to influence him than is really the case i am sure you have somehow or other imbi bed such a notion you must consider me only as m re lliots relation if in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him i beg you would not hesitate to employ me mrs smith gave her a penetrating glance and then smiling said i have been a little premature i perceive i beg your pardon i ought to have waited for off ici al information but now my dear miss elliot as an old friend do give me a hint as to when i may speak next week to be sure by next week i may be allowed to think i tall settled and build my own selfish schemes on m re lliots good fortune no replied anne nor next week nor next nor next i assure youth at nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week i am not going to marry m re llioti should like to know why you imagine i am mrs smith looked at her again looked earnestly smiled shook her head and exclaimed now ho widow is hi understood you ho widow is hi knew what you were at i have a great i death at you do not design to be cruel when the right moment occurs till it does come you know we women never meant o have any body i tis a thing of course among us that every man is refused till he offers but why should you be cruel let me plea d form y present friend i cannot call him but form y former friend where can you look for a more suitable match where could you expect a more gentlemanlike agreeable man let me recommend m re llioti am sure you hear nothing but good of him from colonel wallis and who can k no whim better than colonel wallis my dear mrs smith m re lliots wife has not been dead much above half a year he ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any one oh if these are your only objections cried mrs smith archly m re llio tis safe and i shall give myself no more trouble about him do not forget me when you are married that s all let him know met o be a friend of yours and then he will think little of the trouble required which i tis very natural for him now with so many affairs and engagements of his own to avoid and get rid of a she can very natural perhaps ninety nine out of a hundred would doth e same of course he cannot be aware of the importance tom e well my dear miss ellioti hope and trust you will b every happy m re lliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman your peace will not be shipw re cked as mine has been you are safe in all worldly matters and safe in his character he will not be led astray he will not be misled by others to his ruin no said anne i can readily believe all that of my cousin he seems to have a calm decided temper not a tall o pent o dangerous impression si consider him with great respect i have no reason from anything that has fallen within my observation to do otherwise but i have not known him long and he is not a man i think to be known intimately soon will not this manner of speaking of him mrs smith convince youth a the is nothing tom e surely this must be calm enough and upon my word he is nothing tom e should he ever propose tom e which i ha v every little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing i shall not accept him i assure you i shall not i assure you m re lliot had not the share which you have been supposing in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford not m re llioti tis not m re lliot that she stopped regret t ing with a deep blush that she had implied so much but less would hardly have been sufficient mrs smith would hardly have believed so soon in m re lliots failure but from the perception of there being a somebody el seas it was she instantly submitted and wit hall these mbl an ce of seeing nothing beyond and anne eager to escape farther notice was impatient to know why mrs smith should have fancied shew as to marry m re lliot wheres he could have received the idea or from whom she could have heard it do tell me ho wit first came into your head it first came into my head replied mrs smith upon finding how much you were together and feeling it to be them o st probable thing in the world to be wished for by every body belonging to either of you and you may depend upon it t ha tall your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way but i never heard it spoken of till two days ago and has it indeed been spoken of did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called yesterday no was not it mrs speed as usual or the maid i observed no one in particular it was my friend mrs rooke nurse rooke who by the bye had a great curiosity to see you and was delighted to be in the way to let you in she came away from ma rlbo rough building s only on sunday and she it was who told me you were to marry m re lliot she had had it from mrs wallis herself which did not seem bad authority she sat an hour with me on monday evening and gave met he whole history the whole history repeated anne laughing she could not make a very long history i think of one such little article of un found ed news mrs smiths aid nothing but continued anne presently thought here is no truth in my having this claim on m re llioti should be extremely happy to be of u set o you in any way that i could shall i mention to him your being in bath shall i take any message no i thank you no certainly not in the warmth of the moment and under a mistaken impression i might perhaps have endeavoured to interest you in some circumstances but not n own oi thank you i have nothing to trouble you with i think you spoke of having known m re lliot many years i did not before he was married i suppose ye shew as not married when ikne whim first and were you much acquainted intimately indeed then do tell me what he was at that time of life i have a great curiosity to know what m re lliot was as a very young man wa she a tall such a she appears now i have not seen m re lliot these three years was mrs smiths answer given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther and anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity they were both silent mrs smith very thoughtful at last i beg your pardon my dear miss elliot she cried in her natural tone of cordiality i beg your pardon forth e short answers i have been giving you but i have been uncertain what i ought to do i have been doubt ing and considering as to what i ought to tell youth e re were m anything s to be taken into the account one hate s to be officious to be giving bad impression s making mischief event he smooth sur face of family union seems worth preserving thought here may be nothing durable beneath however i have determined i think i am right i think you ought to be made acquainted with m re lliots real character though i fully believe that at present you have not the smallest intention of accepting him there is no saying what may happen you might some time or other be differently affected towards him h earth e truth therefore now while you are un prejudiced m re llio tis a man without heart or conscience a design ing war y cold blood ed being who thinks only of himself whom for his own interest or ease would be guilty of any cruel tyo ran y treachery that could be per pet rate d without risk of his general character he has no feeling for others those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction he is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion oh he is black at h earth ollo wan d black anne s astonished air and exclamation of wonder made her pause and in a calmer manners he added my expressions start le you you must allow for an injured angry woman but i will try to command myself i will not ab use him i will only tell you what i have found him facts shall speak he was the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him and thought him as good as himself the intimacy had been formed before our marriage i found them most intimate friends and i too became excessively pleased with m re lliot and entertained the highest opinion of him at nineteen you know one does not think very seriously but m re lliot appeared tom e quite as good as others and much more agreeable than most others and we were almost always together we were principally in town living in very good style he was then the inferior in circumstances he was then the poor one he had chambers in the t em plea nd it was as much a she could do to support the appearance of a gentleman he had always a home with us whenever he chose i the was always welcome he was like a brother my poor c ha rles who had the finest most generous spirit in the world would have divided his last far thing with him and i know t ha this purse was o pent o him i know that he often assisted him this must have been about that very period of m re lliots life said anne which has always excited my particular curiosity it must have been about the same time that he became known tom y father and sister i never kne whim myself i only heard of him but there was a something in his conduct then with regard tom y father and sister and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage which i never could quite reconcile with present times it seemed to announce a different sort of man i know i tall i know i tall cried mrs smith he had been introduced to sir w alter and your sister before i was acquainted with him but i heard him speak of them forever i know he was invited and encouraged and i know he did not choose to go i can satisfy you perhaps on points which you would little expect and as to his marriage i knew all about it at the time i was privy to all the for s and against si was the friend to whom he confide d his hopes and plans and though i did not know his wife previously her inferior situation in society indeed rendered that impossible yet i knew her all her life afterwards or at least till within the last two years of her life and can answer any question you may wish to put nay said anne i have no particular en quiry to make about her i have always understood they were not a happy couple but i should like to know why at that time of his life he should slight my fathers acquaintance a she did my father was certainly disposed to tak every kind and proper notice of him why did m re lliot drawback m re lliot replied mrs smith at that period of his life ha done object in view to make his fortune and by a rather quicker process than the law he was determined to make it by marriage he was determined at least not tom ar it by an imprudent marriage and i know it was his belief whether justly or not of course i cannot decide that your father and sister in their civilities and invitations were design ing a match between the heir and the young lady and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence that was his motive for drawing back i can assure you he told met he whole story he had no concealment s with me it was curious that having just left you behind me in bath my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin and that through him i should be continually hearing of your father and sister he described one miss elliot and i thought very affectionately of the other perhaps cried anne struck by a sudden idea you sometimes spoke of met om re lliot to be sure i did very often i used to boast of my own anne elliot and vouch for your being a very different creature from she checked herself just in time this accounts for something which m re lliot said last night cried anne this explains it i found he had been used to hear of me i could not comprehend how what wild imaginations one forms where dears elf is concerned how sure to be mistaken but i beg your pardon i have interrupted you m re lliot married then completely for money the circumstances probably which first opened your eyes to his character mrs smith hesitated a little here oh those things are too common w he none lives in the world am a nor woman s marrying for money is too common to strike one a sit ought i was very young and associate d only with the young and we were a thoughtless gay set without any strict rules of conduct we lived for enjoyment i think differently now ti mean d sickness and sorrow have given me other notions but at that period i must own i saw nothing reprehensible in what m re lliot was doing to doth e best for himself passed as a duty but was not she a very low woman yes which i objected to but he would not regard money money was all that he wanted her father was agrazier her grand father had been a butcher but that was all nothing shew as a fine woman had had a decent education was brought forward by some cousins thrown by chance into m re lliots company and fell in love with him and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side with respect to her birth all his caution was spent in being secured of there al amount of her fortune before he committed himself depend upon it whatever esteem m re lliot may have for his own situation in life no was a young man he had not the smallest value for i this chance forth ekellynch estate was something bu tall the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt i have often heard him declare that if bar on etc ies were sale able any body should have his for fifty pounds arms and motto name and li very included but i will not pretend to repeat half that i used to hear him say on that subject it would not be fair and yet you ought to have proof for what is all this but assertion and you shall have proof indeed my dear mrs smith i want none cried anne you have asserted nothing contradict or y to what m re lliot appeared to be some years ago this is all in confirmation rather of what we used to hear and believe i am more curious to know why he should be so different now but form y satisfaction if you will have the goodness to ring form ary stay i am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bed room and bringing met he small in laid box which you will find on the upper she lf of the closet anne seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it did as shew as desired the box was brought and placed before her and mrs smith sighing over it as she un locked it said this is full of papers belonging to him tom y husband a small portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him the letter i am looking for wa son e written by m re lliot to him before our marriage and happened to be saved why one can hardly imagine but he was careless and im methodical like other men about those things and when i came to examine his papers i found it with others still more trivial from different people scattered here and there while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed here i tis i would not burn it because being event h en very little satisfied with m re llioti was determined to preserve every do cu men to f former intimacy i have now another motive for being glad that i can produce it this was the letter directed to c ha rles smith esq tunbridge well s and dated from london as far back as july dears m it hi have received yours your kindness almost overpower s me i wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common but i have lived three and twenty years in the world and have seen none like it at present believe me i have none e do f your services being in c as h again give me joy i have got rid of sir w alter and miss they are gone back to kellync hand almost made me s wear to visit them this summer but my first visit to kellynch will be with a survey or to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the h am me r the bar one t never the less is not unlikely to marry again he is quite fool enough if he does however they will leave me in peace which may be a decent equ iv a lent forth er ever si on he is worse than last year i wish i had any name bu tell ioti am sick o fit then am e of w alter i can dropt h an k god and i desire you will never insult me with my second w again meaning forth e rest of my life to be only yours truly w me lliot such a letter could not be read without putting anne in a glow and mrs smith observing the high colour in her faces aid the language i know is highly d is respectful though i have forgot the exact terms i have a perfect impression of the general meaning but it shows youth e man mark his professions tom y poor husband can anything be stronger anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of finding such words applied to her fathers he was obliged to recollect that her seeing the letter was a vi ol at io no f the law s of honour that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such te st im on ies that no private correspondence could b earth e eye of others before she could recover calmness e nought o return the letter which she had been meditating over and say thank youth is is full proof undoubtedly proof of every thing you were saying but why be acquainted with u snow i can explain this too cried mrs smith smiling can you really yes i have shewn you m re lliota shew as a dozen years ago and i will she whim a she i snow i cannot produce written proof again but i can give as au then tic or al te st im on y as you can desire of what he i snow wanting and what he i snow doing he is no hypocri ten ow he truly wants to marry you his present attentions to your family ar every sincere quite from the heart i will give you my authority his friend colonel wallis colonel wallis you are acquainted with him no it does not come tom e in quite so direct a line as that it takes a bend or two but nothing of consequence the stream is as good a sat first the little rub b is hit collect sin the turning s is easily moved away m re lliot talks unreserved ly to colonel wallis of his views on you which said colonel wallis i imagine to be in himself a sensible careful discerning sort of character but colonel wallis has a very pretty silly wife to whom he tells things which he had better not and he repeat si tall to hers he in the overflowing spirits of her recovery repeat si tall to her nurse and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you very naturally brings i tall tom e on monday evening my good friend mrs rooke let me thus much into the secrets of ma rlbo rough building s when i talked of a whole history therefore you see i was not ro man c ing so much as you supposed my dear mrs smith your authority is deficient this will not do m re lliots having any views on me will not in the least account forth e efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father that was all pri or tom y coming to bath i found the month e most friendly terms when i arrived i know you did i know i tall perfectly but indeed mrs smith we must not expect to get real information in such a line facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many to be mis conceived by folly i none and ignorance in another can hardly have much truth left only give me a hearing you will soon be able to judge of the general credit due by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm nobody supposes that you were his first inducement he had seen you indeed before he came to ba than d admired you but without knowing it to be you so says my his to ri an at least is this t rued id he see you last summer or autumn somewhere do w ninth e west to use hero wn words without knowing it to be you he certainly did sofa ri tis very true at ly me i happened to beat ly me well continued mrs smith triumphantly grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted he saw youth en at ly mean d liked you s owe l last o be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in c am d en place as miss anne elliot and from that moment i have no doubt had a double motive in his visits there but there was another and an earlier which i will now explain if there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or im probable stop m em y accounts t ate s that your sisters friend the lady now staying with you whom i have heard you mention came to bath with miss elliot and sir w alter as long ago as september in short when they first came themselves and has been staying there ever since that she is a clever insinuating handsome woman poor and plausible and altogether such in situation and manner as to give a general idea among sir w alter s acquaintance of her meaning to be lady elliot and as general a surprise that miss elliot should be apparently blind to the danger here mrs smith paused a moment but anne had not a word to say and she continued this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family long before you returned to it and colonel wallis had his eye upon your father e nought o be sensible o fit though he did not then visit in c am d en place bu this regard form re lliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there and when m re lliot came to bath for a day or two a she happened to do a little before christmas colonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things and the reports beginning to prevail now you are to understand that time had worked a very material change in m re lliots opinions as to the value of a bar on etc y upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man having long had as much money a she could spend nothing to wish for on the side of ava rice or indulgence he has been gradually learn ing top in his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to i thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased but it i snow a confirmed feeling he cannot b earth e idea of not beings ir william you may guess therefore that then ew she heard from his friend could not b every agreeable and you may guess what it produced the resolution of coming back to bath as soon as possible and of fixing himself here for a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintance and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertain ing the degree of his danger and of circum vent ing the lady if he found it material this was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done and colonel wallis was to assist in every way that he could he was to be introduced and mrs wallis was to be introduced and every body was to be introduced m re lliot came back accordingly an don application was forgiven as you know and re admitted into the family and there it was his constant object and his only object till your arrival added another motive to watch sir w alter and mrs c lay he omit ted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way called a tall hours but i need not be particular on this subject you can imagine what an art ful man would do and with this guide perhaps may recollect what you have seen him do yes said anne you tell me nothing which does not accord with what i have known or could imagine there is always something off en s iv e in the detail s of cunn ing them an oeuv re s of selfishness and d up lic it y must ever be re volt ing but i have heard nothing which really surprise s me i know those who would be shocked by such a representation of m re lliot who would have difficulty in believing it but i have never been satisfied i have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared i should like to know his present opinion as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not lessening i understand replied mrs smith he thinks mrs c lay afraid of him aware t ha these es through her and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence but since he must be absent some time or other i do not perceive how he ca never be secure while she holds her present influence mrs wallis has an amusing idea as nurse tells me that i tis to be put into the marriage articles when you and m re lliot marry that your father is not to marry mrs c lay a scheme worthy of mrs wallis s understanding by all accounts but my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity o fit why to be sure ma am s aids he it would not prevent his marrying any body else and indeed to own the truth i do not think nurse in her heart is a very st r en uo us oppose r of sir w alter s making a second match she must be allowed to be a favour er of matrimony you know and since self will in t rude who can say that she may not have some flying vision s of attending the next lady elliot through mrs wallis s recommendation i am very glad to k no wall this said anne after a little thoughtful nes sit will be more painful tom e in some respects to be in company with him but i shall know better what to do my line of conduct will be more direct m re llio tis evidently adi sing en uo us artificial worldly man who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness but m re lliot was not done with mrs smith had been carried away from her first direction and anne had forgotten in the interest of hero wn family concerns how much had been originally implied against him but her attention wa snow called to the explanation of those first hints and she listened to a recital which i fit did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of mrs smith proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her very deficient both injustice and compassion she learned that the intimacy between them continuing un impair ed by m re lliots marriage they had been as before always together and m re lliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune mrs smith did not want to take blame to herself and was most tender of throwing any on her husband but anne could collect that their income had never been equal to theirs tyle of living and that from the first there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance from his wife s account of him she could discern mr smith to have been a man of warm feelings easy temper careless habits and not strong understanding much more amiable than his friend and very unlike him led by him and probably despise d by him m re lliot raised by his marriage to great afflu en ce and disposed to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without in volv ing himself for wit hall his self indulgence he had become a prudent man and beginning to be rich just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor seemed to have had no concern a tall forth at friends probable f in an ces but on the contrary had been prompt ing and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin and the smiths accordingly had been ruined the husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge o fit they had previously known embarrassment se nought o try the friendship of their friends and to prove that m re lliots had better not be tried but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs was fully known with a confidence in m re lliots regard more creditable to his feelings than his judge men t mr smith had appointed him the exe cut or of his will but m re lliot would not act and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heap e don her in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation had been such as could not be related without an gu is h of spirit or listened to without corresponding indignation anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion answers to urgent applications from mrs smith which all breathe d the same st ern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble and under a cold civility the same hard hearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her it was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and in humanity and anne felt at some moments that no f la grant open cri me could have been worse she had a great dealt o listen to all the particulars of past sad scenes all them in utiae of distress upon distress which in former conversations had been merely hint ed at were dw elton now with a natural indulgence anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief and was only the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friends usual state of mind there wa son e circumstance in the history of her grievances of particular irritation she had good reason to believe that some property of her husband in the west in dies which had been for many years under a sort of se quest r at i on forth e pay men to fits own in cumb ran ces might be recover able by proper measures and this property though not large would be e nought o make her comparatively rich but there was nobody to stir in it m re lliot would do nothing and she could do nothing herself equally d is able d from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness and from employing others by her want of money she had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law this was a cruel aggrav at io no f actually st rai ten ed means to feel that she ought to be in better circumstances that a little trouble in the right place might do it and to f earth at delay might be even weak en ing her claims was hard to bear it wa son this point that she had hoped to engage anne s good offices with m re lliot she had previously in the anticipation of their marriage been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature since he did note v en know her to be in bath it immediately occurred that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved and she had been hastily preparing to interest anne s feelings as far as the observance s due tom re lliots character would allow when anne s re fut at io no f the supposed engagement changed the face of every thing and while it took from her then ew formed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story hero wn way after listening to this full description of m re lliot anne could not but express some surprise at mrs smiths having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversations he had seemed to recommend and praise him my dear was mrs smiths reply there was nothing else to be done i considered your marrying him ascertain though he might not yet have made the offer and i could no more speak the truth of him than if he had been your husband my heart b led for you as i talked of happiness and yet he is sensible he is agreeable and with such a woman as you it was not absolutely hopeless he was very unkind to his first wife they were wretched together but shew as too ignorant and giddy for respect and he had never loved her i was willing to hope that you must fare better anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him as made hers hud de r at the idea of the misery which must have followed it was just possible that she might have been persuaded by lady r us sell and under such a supposition which would have been most miserable when time had d is closed all too late it was very desirable that lady r us sell should b en o longer deceived an done of the concluding arrangements of this important c on fer en ce which carried them through the greater part of the morning was that anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend every thing relative tom rs smith in which his conduct was involved chapter anne went home to think over all that she had heard i none point her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of m re lliot there was no longer anything of tenderness due to him he stood as opposed to captain went worth in all his own unwelcome obtr us iv en ess and the evil of his attentions last night their r em edi able mischief he might have done was considered with sensations unqualified un perplexed pity for him was al lover but this was the only point of relief in every other respect in looking around hero r penetrating forwards he saw more to distrust and to apprehend shew as concerned forth e disappointment and pain lady r us sell would be feeling forth e mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils without knowing how to avert any one of t hems he was most thankful for hero wn knowledge of him she had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not slighting an old friend like mrs smith bu there was a reward indeed sp ringing from it mrs smith had be enable to tell her what no one else could have done could the knowledge have been extended through her family but this was a vain ideas he must talk to lady r us sell tell her consult with her and having done her best wait the event with as much composure as possible and after all her greatest want of composure would be in that quarter of them in d which could not be opened to lady r us sell in that flow of an xi e ties and fears which must be all to herself she found on reaching home that she had as she intended escaped seeing m re lliot that he had called and paid them along morning visit but hardly had she congratulated herself and felt safe when she heard that he was coming agai ninth e evening i had not the smallest intention of asking him said elizabeth with affected carelessness but he gave so many hints so mrs c lay says at least indeed i do say it i never sa wan y body in my life spell hard er for an invitation poor man i was really in pain for him for your hard hearted sister miss anne seems bent on cruel ty oh cried elizabeth i have been rather too mu chuse d to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman s hints however when i found how excessively he was regret t ing that he should miss my father this morning i gave way immediately for i would never really omit an opportunity of bring him and sir w alter together they appear to so much advantage in company with each o the reach behaving so pleasantly m re lliot looking up with so much respect quite delightful cried mrs c lay not daring however to turn her eyes towards anne exactly like father and son dear miss elliot may i not say father and son oh i lay no em bar go on any body s words if you will have such ideas but upon my word i am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men my dear miss elliot exclaimed mrs c lay l if t ing her hands and eyes and sinking all there s to f her astonishment in a convenient silence well my dear pen elope you need not be so alarmed about him i did invite him you know i sent him away with smiles when i found he was really going to his friends at th or n be rry park forth e whole day to morrow i had compassion on him anne admired the good acting of the friend in being able to shews uch pleasure as she di dint he expectation an dint he actual arrival of th every person whose presence must really be in terfe ring with her prime object it was impossible but that mrs c lay must hate the sight of m re lliot and yet she could assume a most obliging p la cid look and appear quite satisfied with the curtai led l ice n se of devoting herself only half as much to sir w alter as she would have done otherwise to anne herself it was most distressing to seem re lliot enter t hero om and quite painful to have him approach and speak to hers he had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere but now she sa win sincerity in every thing his attentive deference to her father contrasted with his former language was odious and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards mrs smiths he could hardly b earth e sight of his presents miles and mildness or the sound of his artificial good sentiments she meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a remonstrance on his side it was a great object to her to escape all en quiry or eclat but it wa she r intention to be as decidedly cool to him as might be compatible with their relations hip and to re trace as quietly as she could the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had been gradually led along shew as accordingly more guarded and more cool than she had been the night before he wanted to an im ate her curiosity again as to ho wan d where he could have heard her formerly praised wanted very much to be gratified by more solicitation but the charm was broken he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary to kind le his modest cousins vanity he found at least that it was not to be done now by any of those attempts which he could hazard among the too commanding claims of the others he little surmised that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct which were least excusable she had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of bath the next morning going early and that he would be gone the greater part of two days he was invited again to c am d en place th every evening of his return but from thurs day to saturday evening his absence w ascertain it was bad e nought hat a mrs c lay should be always before her but that a deeper hypocr it e should be added to their party seemed the de st ructio no f every thing like peace and comfort it was so hum ili at ing to reflect on the constant de cepti on practised on her father and elizabeth to consider the various sources of mortification preparing forth em mrs c lay s selfishness was not so complic ate nor sore volt ing as his and anne would have compoun de d forth e marriage at once wit hall its evils to be clear of m re lliotssubtle ties in endeavouring to prevent it on friday mornings he meant to go very early to lady r us sell and accomplish the necessary communication and she would have gone directly after breakfast but that mrs c lay was also going out on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble which determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companions he saw mrs c lay fairly off therefore before she began total k of spending the morning in river s street very well said elizabeth i have nothing to send but my love oh you may a swell take back that tiresome books he would l end mean d pretend i have read it through i really cannot be p la gu ing myself forever wit hall then ew poem s and state s of then at i on that come out lady r us sell quite bore son e with her new public at i on s you need not tell hers o but i thought her dress hid eo us the other night i used to thinks he had some taste in dress but i was ashamed of her at the concert something so formal and arrange in her air and she s its so upright my best love of course and mine added sir w alter kindest regards and you may say that i meant o call upon hers o on make a civil message but i shall only leave my card morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life whom ake themselves up so little if she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of beings e en but last time i called i observed the blinds were let down immediately while her fathers poke there was a knock at the door who could it be anne remembering the pre concert ed visits a tall hours of m re lliot would have expected him but for his known engagements even miles off after the usual period of suspense the usual sounds of approach were heard and mr and mrs c ha rlesm us grove were ushered in t other oom surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance but anne was really glad to see them and the others were not so sorry but that they could put on a decent air of welcome and as soon a sit became clear that these their nearest relations were not arrived wi than views of accommodation in that houses irw alter and elizabeth were able to rise in cordiality and doth e honours o fit very well they were come to bath for a few days with mrs m us grove and were at the white h art so much was pretty soon understood but till sir w alter and elizabeth were walking ma ry into the other drawing room and re g al ing themselves with her admiration anne could not draw upon c ha r less brain for a regular history of their coming o ran explanation of some smiling hints of particular business which had been os ten t at iou sly dropped by ma rya swell as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party c on s is te do f she then found that it c on s is te do f mrs m us grove h en rietta and captain ha rv ill e be side their two selves he gave her a very plain intelligible account of the whole a narration in which she saw a great deal of most characteristic proceeding the scheme had received its first impulse by captain ha rv ill es wanting to come to bath on business he had begun total ko fit a week ago and by way of doing something as shoot ing was over c ha rles had proposed coming with him and mrs ha rv ill e had seemed to like the idea o fit very much as an advantage to her husband but ma ry could not bear to be left and had made herself so unhappy about it that for a day or two every thing seemed to be in suspense or a tan end but then it had been taken up by his father and mother his mother had some old friends in bath whom she wanted to see it was thought a good opportunity for h en riett at oco mean d buy wedding clothes for herself and her sister and in short it ended in being his m others party that every thing might be comfortable and easy to captain ha rv ill e and he and ma ry were included in it by way of general convenience they had arrived late the night before mrs ha rv ill e her children and captain b en wick remained with mr m us grove and lou is a at upper cross anne s only surprise was that affairs should be in forward ness enough for h en riett as wedding clothes to be talked of she had imagined such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage from being near a than d but she learned from c ha rles that very recently since ma rys last letter to herself c ha rles hay ter had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could not possibly claim it under many years and that on the strength of his present income with almost a certainty of something more permanent long before the term in question the two families had consented to the young people s wishes and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months quite as soon as lou is as and a very good living it was c ha rles added only five and twenty miles from upper cross and in a very fine country fine part of do r sets hi re in the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom surrounded by three great proprietor s each more careful and jealous than the other and to two of the three at least c ha rles hay ter might get as peci al recommendation not that he will value it a she ought he observed c ha rles is too cool about sport ing that s the worst of him i am extremely glad indeed cried anne particularly glad that this should happen and that of two sisters who both deserve equally well and who have always been such good friends the pleasant prospect of one should not bed imm ing those of the other that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort i hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both oh yes my father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were rich er but he has no other fault to find money you know coming down with money two daughters at once it cannot be a very agreeable operation and its tr eight en s him as tom anything s however i do not meant o say they have not aright to it i tis very fit they should have daughters share s and i am sure he has always been a very kind liberal father tom em ary does not above half like h en riett as match she never did you know but she does not do him justice nor think enough about win thropi cannot make her attend to the value of the property i tis a very fair match as times go and i have liked c ha rles hay ter all my life and i shall not leave off now such excellent parents as mr and mrs m us grove exclaimed anne should be happy in their children s marriages they do every thing to c on fer happiness i am sure what a blessing to young people to be in such hands your father and m others e em so totally free from all those am bit io us feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery bo thin young and old i hope you think lou is a perfectly recovered now he answered rather hesitatingly yes i believe i do very much recovered but she is altered there is no running or jumping about no laughing or dancing i tis quite different if one happens only to shut the door a little hard she s tarts and wriggles like a young dabchick in the water and b en wicks its at her elbow reading verses or whispering to her all day long anne could not help laughing that cannot be much to your taste i knows aids he but i do believe him to be an excellent young man to be sure he is nobody doubts it and i hope you do not think i am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself i have a great value for b en wick and w he none can but get him total k he has plenty to say his reading has done him no harm for he has f ought a swell as read he is ab rave fellow i got more acquainted with him last monday t ha never i did before we had a famous set to at r at hunting all the morning in my fathers great bar ns and he played his parts o well that i have liked him the better ever since here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of c ha r less following the others to admire mirr or s and ch in a but anne had heard e nought o understand the presents t ate of upper cross and rejoice in its happiness and though she sighed as she rejoiced her sigh had none of the ill will of envy in it she would certainly have ri sent o their blessings if she could but she did not want to lessen theirs the visit passed off altogether in high good humour ma ry was in excellent spirits enjoying the gaiety and the change and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother in law s carriage with four horses and with hero wn complete independence of c am d en place that shew as exactly in a temper to admire every thing as she ought and enter most readily into all the superior i ties of the house as they were detailed to hers he had no demands on her father or sister and her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome drawing rooms elizabeth was for a short time suffering a good deal she felt that mrs m us grove and all her party ought to be asked to dine with them but she could not bear to have the difference of style there ductio no f servants which a dinner must betray witnessed by those who had been always so inferior to the elliots of kellync hit was a struggle between propriety and vanity but vanity got the better and then elizabeth was happy again these were her internal persuasions old fashioned notions country hospitality we do not pr of ess to give dinners few people in bath do lady al icia never does did note v en ask hero wn sisters family thought he y were here a month and i dares ay it would b every inconvenient tom rsm us grove put her quite out of her way i am sure she would rather not comes he cannot feel easy with us i will ask them all for an evening that will be much better that will be a novelty and a treat they have not seen two such drawing rooms before they will be delighted to come to morrow evening it shall be a regular party small b utmost elegant and this satisfied elizabeth and when the invitation was given to the two present and promised forth e absent ma ry was as completely satisfied shew as particularly asked to meet m re lliot and be introduced to lady d al rym plea nd miss carte re t who were fortunately already engaged to co mean d she could not have received a more gratifying attention miss elliot was to have the honour of calling on mrs m us grove in the course of the morning and anne walked off with c ha rles and ma ry to go and see her and h en rietta directly her plan of sitting with lady r us sell must give way forth e present they all three called in river s street for a couple of minutes but anne convinced herself that a days delay of the intended communication could be of no consequence and hasten ed forward to the white h art to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn wi than eagerness of goodwill which many associations contributed to form they found mrs m us grove and her daughter within and by themselves and anne had the kindest welcome from each h en rietta was exactly in that state of recently improved views of fresh formed happiness which made her full of regard and interest forever y body she had ever liked before a tall and mrs m us grove s real affection had been w on by her usefulness when they were in distress it was a heart in ess and a warmth and a sincerity which anne delighted in the more from the sad want of such blessings at homes he was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible invited for everyday and all day long or rather claimed as part of the family and in return she naturally fell into all her w on ted ways of attention and assistance an don c ha r less leaving them together was listening tom rsm us grove s history of lou is a and to h en riett as of herself giving opinions on business and recommendations to shops with intervals of every help which ma ry required from alter ing her ribbon to settling her accounts from finding her key s and as sort ing her tr in kets to trying to convince her that shew as no till used by any body which ma ry well amused as she generally was in her station at a window overlook ing the entrance to the pump room could not but have her moments of imagining a morning of thorough confusion was to be expected a large party in an hot el ensure da quick changing unsettled scene one five minutes brought a note the next a parcel and anne had not been there half an hour when their dining room spacious a sit was seemed more than half filled a party of steady old friends were seated around mrs m us grove and c ha rles came back with captain s ha rv ill e and went worth the appearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the moment it was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together again their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings she had derived from it a delightful conviction but she feared from his looks that the same unfortunate persuasion which had hasten ed him away from the concert room still governed he did not seem to want to be near enough for conversations he tried to be calm and leave things to take their course and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence surely if there be constant attachment on each side our hearts must understand each o there re long wear e not boy and girl to be captious ly irritable misled by every moments in adver ten ce and want only playing wit hour own happiness and yet a few minutes afterwards she felt as if their being in company with each other under their present circumstances could only be expo sing them to in adver ten cies and mis construction s of them o st mischievous kind anne cried ma ry still at her window there is mrs c lay i am sure standing under the col on na de and a gentleman with her i saw them turn the corner from bath street just now they seemed deep in talk who i sit co mean d tell me good heavens i recollect i tis m re lliot himself no cried anne quickly it cannot b em re llioti assure you he was to leave ba that nine this morning and does not come back till to morrow as she spoke she felt that captain went worth was looking at her the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her and made her regret that she had s aids o much simple a sit was ma ry resent ing that she should be supposed not to know hero wn cousin began talking very warmly about the family features and protesting still more positively that it was m re lliot calling again upon anne to co mean d look for herself but anne did not meant o stir and tried to be cool and unconcerned her distress returned however on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between two or three of the lady visitors as if they believed themselves quite in the secret it was evident that the report concern ing her had spread and a short pause succeeded which seemed to ensure that it would now spread farther do co mean ne cried ma ryco mean d look yourself you will be too late if you do not make has te they are parting they are shaking hands he is turning away not know m re lliot indeed you seem to have forgot all about ly met opac if y ma ry and perhaps screen hero wn embarrassment anne did move quietly to the windows he was just in time to ascertain that it really was m re lliot which she had never believed before he d is appeared o none s ideas mrs c lay walked quickly off on the other and checking the surprise which she could not but feel at such an appearance of friendly c on fer en ce between two persons of totally opposite interests he calmly said yes i tis m re lliot certainly he has changed his hour of going i suppose that is all or i may be mistaken i might not attend and walked back to her chair re composed and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well the visitors took their leave and c ha rles having civilly seen them off and then made a face at them and abused them for coming began with well mother i have done something for youth at you will like i have been to the t heat re and secured a box for to morrow night an tia good boy i know you love a play and there is room for us all it holds nine i have engaged captain went worth anne will not be sorry to join us i am sure we all like a play have not i done well mother mrs m us grove was goodhumoured ly beginning to express her perfect readiness forth e play if h en rietta and all the others liked it when ma ry eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming good heavens c ha rle show can you think of such a thing take a box for to morrow night have you forgot that wear e engaged to c am d en place to morrow night and that we were most particularly asked to meet lady d al rym plea nd her daughter and m re lliot and all the principal family connexions on purpose to be introduced to them how can you be so forget fulphoophoo replied c ha rles what s an evening party never worth remembering your father might have asked us to dinner i think if he had wanted to see us you may do as you like but i shall got o the play oh c ha rlesi declare it will be too abominable if you do when you promised to go no i did not promise i only smirked and bowed and said the word happy there was no promise but you must go c ha rle sit would be unpardonable to fail we were asked on purpose to be introduced there was always such a great connexion between the d al rymples and ourselves nothing ever happened o neither side that was not announced immediately wear e quite near relations you know and m re lliot too whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with every attention is due tom re lliot consider my fathers heir the future represent at iv e of the family don t talk tom eabou theirs and represent at iv es cried c ha rlesi am no tone of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun if i would not go forth e sake of your father i should think its can d al o us to go forth e sake of his heir what is m re lliot to met he careless expression was life to anne who saw that captain went worth was all attention looking and listening with his whole soul and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from c ha r lest o herself c ha rles and ma ry still talked o ninth e same style he half serious and half je sting maintaining the scheme forth e play and she in variably serious most warmly opposing it and not omitting to make it known that however determined to got oc am d en place herself she should not think herself very well used if they went to the play without her mrs m us grove interposed we had better put it off c ha rles you had much better go back and change the box for tuesday it would be a pity to be divided and we should be losing miss anne too if there is a party at her fathers and i am sure neither h en rietta nor i should care a tall forth e play if miss anne could not be with us anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness and quite as much so forth e opportunity it gave hero f decidedly saying i fit depended only on my inclination ma am the party at home excepting on ma rys account would not be the smallest impediment i have no pleasure in the sort of meeting and should be too happy to change it for a play and with you but it had better not be attempted perhaps she had spoken it but she trembled when it was done conscious that her words were listened to and daring not event o try to observe their effect it was soon generally agreed that tuesday should be the day c ha rles only re se rv ing the advantage of still tea sing his wife by persisting that he would got o the play to morrow if nobody else would captain went worth lef this seat and walked to the fire place probably forth e sake of walking away from it soon afterwards and taking a station with less bare face d design by anne you have not been long enough in bath said he to enjoy the evening parties of the place oh not he usual character of them has nothing form ei am no card player you were not formerly i know you did not u set o like cards but time makes many changes i am not yet so much changed cried anne and stopped fearing she hardly knew what mis construction after waiting a few moments he said and as i fit were the result of immediate feeling i tis a period indeed eight years and a half is a period whether he would have proceeded farther was left to anne s imagination top on de r over in a calmer hour for while still hearing the sounds he had uttered shew as startled tooth er subjects by h en rietta eager to make use of the present leisure forgetting out and calling on her companions to lose no time lest somebody else should come in they were obliged to move anne talked of being perfectly ready and tried to look it but she felt that could h en rietta have known the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair in preparing to quit the rooms he would have found in all hero wn sensations for her cousin in th every security of his affection where with to pity her their preparations however were stopped short alarming sounds were heard other visitors approached and the door was thrown open for sir w alter and miss elliot whose entrance seemed to give a general c hill anne felt an instant oppression and wherever she looked saw symptoms of the same the comfort the freedom the gaiety of t hero om was over hush e dint o cold composure determined silence or insipid talk to meet the he artless elegance of her father and sister how mortifying to feel that it was so her jealous eye was satisfied i none particular captain went worth was acknowledged again by each by elizabeth more graciously than before she even addressed him once and looked at him more than once elizabeth was in fact re volv ing a great measure the sequel explained it after the waste of a few minutes in saying the proper nothing s she began to give the invitation which was to comp rise all the remaining due s of them us grove s to morrow evening to meet a few friends no formal party it was all said very graceful ly and the cards with which she had provided herself them is sell iot at home were laid on the table with a court eo us com pre h en s iv e smile to all an done smile an done card more decidedly for captain went worth the truth was that elizabeth had been long enough in bath to understand the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his the past was nothing the present was that captain went worth would move about well in her drawing room the card was pointedly given and sir w alter and elizabeth arose and d is appeared the interruption had been short though severe and ease and animation returned to most of those they left as the doors hut them out but not to anne she could think only of the invitations he had with such astonishment witnessed and of the manner in which it had been received a manner of doubtful meaning of surprise rather than gratification of polite acknowledge men t rather than acceptance she kne whims he saw disdain in his eye and could not venture to believe that he had determined to accepts uch an offering as an atonement for all the insolence of the past her spirits s an k he held the card in hi shan d after they were gone as if deeply considering it only think of elizabeth s including every body whispered ma ry very audibly i do not wonder captain went worth is delighted you see he cannot put the card out of hi shan d anne caught his eyes aw his cheeks glow and his mouth form itself into a momentary expression of c on tempt and turned away that she might neither seen or hear more to vex her the party separated the gentlemen had their own pursuits the ladies proceeded on their own business and they met no more while anne belonged to t hems he was earnestly begged to return and dine and give them all there s to f the day but her spirits had been so long exerted that at presents he felt unequal to more and fit only for home wheres he might be sure of being as silent as she chose promising to be with them the whole of the following morning therefore she closed the fatigues of the present by at oil some walk to c am d en place there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements of elizabeth and mrs c lay forth e morrows party the frequent en u me r at io no f the persons invited and the continually improving detail o fall the em bell is h men ts which were to make it them o st completely elegant o fit skin d in bath while ha r as sing herself with the never ending question of whether captain went worth would come or not they were reckoning him ascertain but with her it was agna win g solicitude never appeased for five minutes together she generally thought he would come because she generally thought he ought but it was a case which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion as inevitably to de fy the suggestions of very opposite feelings she only roused herself from the brood ing s of this restless agitation to let mrs c lay know that she had been seen with m re lliot three hours after his being supposed to be out of bath for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview from the lady herself she determined to mention it and it seemed to her there was guilt in mrs c lay s face as she listened it was t ran si en t cleared away in an instant but anne could imagines here ad there the consciousness of having by some complic at io no f mutual trick or some over bearing authority of his been obliged to attend perhaps for half an hour to his lecture s and re strict i on son her designs on sir w alter she exclaimed however with a very tolerable imitation of nature oh dear very true only think miss elliot tom y great surprise i met with m re lliot in bath street i was never more astonished he turned back and walked with met o the pumpyard he had been prevented setting off forth or n be rry but i really forget by what for i was in a hurry and could not much attend and i can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return he wanted to know how early he might be admitted to morrow he was full of to morrow and i tis very evident that i have been full o fit too ever since i entered the house and learnt the ex tens io no f your plan and all that had happened or my seeing him could never have g ones o entirely out of my head chapter one day only had passed since anne s conversation with mrs smith bu take en er interest had succeeded and shew a snows o little touched by m re lliots conduct except by its effects i none quarter that it became a matter of course the next mornings till to defer here x plan at or y visit in river s streets he had promised to be with them us grove s from breakfast to dinner her faith was p lighted and m re lliots character like the s ult an esssc he her aza de s head must live another days he could not keep her ap point men t punctually however the weather was unfavourable and she had grieved over the rain on her friends account and felt it very much on hero wn before shew as able to attempt the walk when she reached the white h art and made her way to the proper apartments he found herself neither arriving quite in time north e first to arrive the party before her were mrs m us grove talking tom rscr of t and captain ha r vi l let o captain went worth and she immediately heard that ma ry and h en rietta too impatient to wait had gone out the moment it had cleared but would be back a gains o on and that the strict e st injunction s had been left with mrs m us grove to keep her there till they returned she had only to submit sit down be outwardly composed and feel herself plunged at once in all the agitation s which she had merely laid her account of ta sting a little before the morning closed there was no delay no waste of times he was deep in the happiness of such misery or the misery of such happiness instantly two minutes after her entering t hero om captain went worth said we will write the letter we were talking of ha rv ill e now if you will give me material s material s were a than don a separate table he went to it and nearly turning his back to them all was engrossed by writing mrs m us grove was giving mrs cr of t the history of her eldest daughters engagement and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation and yet as captain ha rv ill e seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talks he could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars such a show mr m us grove and my brother hay ter had met again and again total k it over what my brother hay ter had sai done day and what mr m us grove had proposed the next and what had occurred tom y sister hay ter and what the young people had wished and what i said at first i never could consent to but was afterwards persuaded to think might do very well and a great deal in the same style of open hearted communication m in utiae which even with every advantage of taste and delicacy which good mrs m us grove could not give could be properly interesting only to the principals mrs cr of t was attending with great good humour and whenever she spoke a tall it was very s en sibly anne hoped the gentlemen might each be too much self occupied to hear and so ma am all these thing considered said mrs m us grove in her powerful whisper though we could have wished it different yet altogether we did not think it fair to stand out any longer for c ha rles hay ter was quite wild about it and h en rietta was pretty near as bad and s owe thought they had better marry

rather have young people settle on a small income at once and have to struggle with a few difficulties together than be involved in along engagement i always think that no mutual oh dear mrs cr of t cried mrs m us grove unable to let her finish her speech there is nothing is oabom in ate for young people as along engagement i tis what i always protested against form y children i tis all very well i used to say for young people to be engaged if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months or even in twelve but along engagement yes dear ma am said mrs cr of to ran uncertain engagement an engagement which may belong to begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying i hold to b every unsafe and un wise and what i think all parents should prevent as far as they can anne found an unexpected interest here she felt its application to herself felt it in a nervous thr ill al lover her and at the same moment t ha there yes instinctive ly glanced towards the distant table captain went worth s pen ceased to move his head was raised pa using listening and he turned round the next instant to give a look one quick conscious look at her the two ladies continued total k to re urge the same admitted truths and en force them with such example soft he ill effect of a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation but anne heard nothing distinctly it was only abuzz of words in here ar her mind was in confusion captain ha rv ill e who had in truth been hearing none o fit now lef this seat and moved to a window and anne seeming to watch him though it was from thorough absence of mind became gradually sensible that he was inviting her to join him where he stood he looked at her with a smile and al it tl emotion of the head which expressed come tom ei have something to say and the unaffected easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really was strongly en forced the invitations he roused herself and went to him the window at which he stood was at the o there n do ft hero om from where the two ladies were sitting and though nearer to captain went worth stable not very near as she joined him captain ha rv ill es countenance re assume d the serious thoughtful expression which seemed its natural character look here said he un folding a parcel in hi shan d and displaying a small m in i at u re pain t ing do you know who that is certainly captain b en wick yes and you may guess who i tis for but in a deep tone it was not done for her miss elliot do you remember our walking together at ly mean dgriev ing for him i little thought then but no matter this was drawn at the cape he met with a clever young ger man artist at the cape and in compliance with a promise tom y poor sisters at to him and was bringing it home for her and i have now the charge of getting it properly set for another it was a commission tom e but who else was there to employ i hope i can allow for him i am not sorry indeed to make it over to another he undertakes it looking towards captain went worth he is writing about it no wan d with a quivering lip he wound up the whole by adding poor f an ny she would not have forgotten him so soon no replied anne in a low feeling voice that i can easily believe it was not in her nature she do te don him it would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved captain ha rv ill e smiled as much as to say do you claim that for yours ex and she answered the questions mil ing also yes we certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget u sit is perhaps our fate rather than our merit we cannot help ourselves we live at home quiet confined and our feelings pre y upon us you are forced on exertion you have always a profession pursuits business of some sort or other to take you back into the world immediately and continual occupation and changes o on weak en impression s grant ing your assertion that the world does all this so soon form en which however i do not think i shall grant it does not apply to b en wick he has not been forced upon any exertion the peace turned him on sh or eat th every moment and he has been living with u sin our little family circle ever since true said an n every true i did not recollect but what shall we say now captain ha rv ill e if the change be not from outward circumstances it must be from within it must be nature man s nature which has done the business for captain b en wick non oi tis not man s nature i will not allow it to be more man s nature than woman s to be in constant and forget those they do love or have loved i believe the reverse i believe in a true analogy between our bodily frame s and our mental and that a sour bodies are the strongest so are our feelings capable of bearing most rough usage and riding out the he a vi e st weather your feelings may be the strongest replied anne but the same spirit of analogy will author is e met o assert that ours are them o st tender man is more rob us t than woman but he is not longer lived which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments nay it would be too hard upon you i fit were otherwise you have difficulties and privations and dangers e nought o struggle with you are always labouring and to il ing exposed to every risk and hardship your home country friends all quitted neither time nor health nor life to be called your own it would be hard indeed with af alter ing voice if woman s feelings were to be added to all this we shall never agree upon this question captain ha rv ill e was beginning to say when a slight noise called their attention to captain went worth s hitherto perfectly quiet division of t hero omit was nothing more than t ha this pen had fallen down but anne was startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed and half inclined to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been occupied by them striving to catch sounds which yet she did not think he could have caught have you finished your letters aid captain ha rv ill e not quite a few lines more i shall have done in five minutes there is no hurry on my side i am only ready whenever you are i am in very good an ch or age here smiling at anne well supplied and want for nothing no hurry for a sign al a tall well miss elliot lowering his voice as i was saying we shall never agree i suppose upon this point no man and woman would probably but let me observe t ha tall hi stories are against you all stories prose and verse if i had such a memory as b en wicki could bring you fifty quot at i on sin a moment on my side the argument an did o not think i ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman s inconstancy songs and proverb s all talk of woman sfickl en ess but perhaps you will say these were all written by men perhaps i shall yes yes if you please no refer en ce to example sin books men have had every advantage of u sin telling their own story education has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen has been in their hands i will not allow books to prove anything but how shall we prove anything we never shall we never can expect to prove anything upon such a point i tis a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof we each begin probably with a little bias towards ou row n sex and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour o fit which has occurred within ou row n circle many of which circumstances perhaps thos every cases which strike us them o st may be precisely such as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence or in some respects ay ing what should not be said ah cried captain ha rv ill e in a tone of strong feeling if i could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes alas t look a this wife and children and watches the bo at that he h assent them off in as long a sit is insight and then turns away and says god knows whether we ever meet again and then if i could convey to youth e glow of his soul when he does see them again when coming back after a twelvemonth s absence perhaps and obliged to put into another p or the calculate shows o on it be possible to get them there pretending to deceive himself and saying they cannot be here till such a day bu tall the while hoping forth em twelve hours sooner and seeing them arrive at last as if heaven had given them win gs by many hours sooner still if i could explain to you all this and all that a man can bear and do and gl or ies to do forth e sake of these treasure s of his existence i speak you know only of such men as have hearts pressing his own with emotion oh cried anne eagerly i hope i do justice to all that is felt by you and by those who resemble you god forbid that i should under value the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow creatures i should deserve utter c on tempt if i dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman no i believe you capable of every thing great and good in your married lives i believe you equal to every important exertion and to every domestic forbearance so long as if i may be allowed the expressions o long as you have an object i meanwhile the woman you love lives and lives for you all the privilege i claim form y own sex i tis not a very enviable one you need not coveti tis that of lov ing longest when existence or when hope is g ones he could not immediately have uttered another sentence her heart was too full her breath too much oppressed you are a good soul cried captain ha rv ill e putting hi shan don her arm quite

nor a look he had passed out of t hero om without a looks he had only time however to move closer to the table where he had been writing when footsteps were heard returning the door opened it was

c ha rles ma ry and h en rietta all came in the absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then an immediate struggle but after a while she could don o more she began not to understand a word they said and was obliged to plea d indisposition and excuse herself they could then see that she looked very ill were shocked and concerned and would not stir without her forth e world this was dreadful would they only have gone away and left her in the quiet possession of that room it would have been her cure but to have them all standing or waiting around her was d is tr acting and in de

you but i am nod oc to r myself c ha rles ring and order a chair she must not walk but the chair would never do worse than all to lose the possibility of speaking two words to captain went worth in the course of her quiet solitary progress up the town and she felt almost certain of meeting him could not be borne the chair was earnestly protested against and mrs m us grove who thought only of one sort of illness having assured herself with some anxiety that there had been no fall in the case that anne had not at any time lately s lip ped down and got a blow on her head that shew as perfectly convinced of having had no fall could part with her cheerfully and depend on finding her better at night anxious to omit no possible precaution anne struggled and said i am afraid ma am that i tis not perfectly understood pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening i am afraid there had been some mistake and i wish you particularly to assure captain ha rv ill e and captain went worth that we hope to see them both oh my dear i tis quite understood i give you my word captain ha rv ill e has no thought but of going do you thinks o but i am afraid and i should be so very sorry will you promise met o mention it when you see them again you will see them both this morning i dares ay do promise met o be sure i will if you wish it c ha

captain went worth the same i dares ay anne could don o more but her heart prop he sied some mis chance to damp the perfection of her felicity it could not b every lasting however even if he did not come to c am d en place himself it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence by captain ha rv ill e another momentary vexation occurred c ha rle sin his real concern and good nature would go home with her there was no preventing him this was almost cruel but she could not belong ungrateful he was sacrificing an engagement at agun smiths to be of u set o her and she set off with him with no feeling but gratitude apparent they were on union street when a quicker step behind a something of familiar sound gave her two moments preparation forth e sight of captain went worth he joined them but as if irresolute whether to join or top as sons aid nothing only looked anne could command herself e nought o receive that look and not repulsive ly the cheeks which had been pale now glow ed and the movements which had hesitated were decided he walked by hers i de presently struck by a sudden thought c ha rles said captain went worth which way are you going only to gay street or farther up the town i hardly know replied captain went worth surprise dare you going as high as be lm on t are you going near c am d en place because if you are i shall have no scruple in asking y out o take my place and give anne your arm to her fathers doors he is rather done forth is morning and must not go sofa r without help and i ought to beat that fellows in the market place he promised met he

soon words enough had passed between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk where the power of conversation would make the present hour a blessing indeed and prepare it for all the imm or t al it y which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow there they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once be foresee me d to secure every thing but which had been followed by so many many years of division and e strange men t there they returned again into the past more exquisite ly happy perhaps in their re union than when it had been first projected more tender more tried more fixed in a knowledge of each others character truth and attachment more equal to act more justified in acting and there as they slowly pace d the gradual as c en the ed less of every group around them seeing neither sauntering politician sb us tl ing housekeeper sflirt ing girls nor nursery maids and children they could indulge in those retrospect i on s and acknowledge men ts and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest all

doubt the to r men t that had begun too pe rate in th every hour of first meeting her in bath that had returned after a short suspension to ruin the concert and that had influenced him in every thing he had said and done or omit ted to say and do in the last four and twenty hours it had been gradually yielding to the better hopes which her looks or words or actions occasionally encouraged it had been v an qui she d at last by those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked with captain ha rv ill e and under the irresistible g over n an ce of which he had seized a sheet of paper and pour e do u this feelings of what he had then written nothing was to be retract e do r qualified he pers is ted in having loved none but hers he had never been supplanted he never even believed himself to see her equal thus much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge that he had been constant unconsciously nay un intentionally that he had meant to forget her and believed it to be done he had imagined himself indifferent when he had only been angry and he had been unjust to her merits because he had been a suffer er from them her character wa snow fixed on his mind as perfection itself maintaining the love lies t medium of fortitude and gentleness but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at upper cross had he learnt to do her justice and only at ly me had he begun to understand himself at ly me he had received lessons of more t ha none sort the passing admiration of m re lliot had at least roused him and the scenes on the cob band at captain ha rv ill es had fixed her superiority in his pre ced ing attempts to attach himself to lou is am us grove the attempts of angry pride he protested that he had forever felt it to be impossible that he had not cared could not care for lou is a thought ill that day till the leisure for reflection which followed i the had not understood the perfect excellence of them in d with which lou is as could so ill bear a comparison or the perfect un rival led hold it possessed over his own there he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle and the ob st in acy of self will between the daring s of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind there he had seen every thing to ex al t in his estimation the woman he had lo stand there begun to deplore the pride the folly the madness of

others might have felt the same hero wn family nay perhaps herself i was no longer at my own d is pos al i was hers in honour if she wished it i had been un guarded i had not thought seriously on this subject before i had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger o fill consequence in many ways and that i had no right to be trying whether i could attach myself to either of the girls at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report were there no other ill effects i had been grossly wrong and must abide the consequences he found too late in short that he had entangled himself

enquired after you very particularly asked even if you were personally altered little suspecting that tom y eye you could never alter anne smiled and let it pass it was too pleasing a blunder for a reproach i tis something for a woman to be assured in her eight and twentieth y earth at she has not lo stone charm of earlier youth but the value of such hom age was inexpressibly increased to anne by comparing it with former words and feeling it to be the result not the cause o fare vi v al of his warm attachment he had remained in shropshi re lamenting the blindness of his own pride and the blunders of his own calculation still at once released from lou is a by the astonishing and felic it o us intelligence of her engagement with b en wick here said he ended the worst of my state for now i could at least put myself in the way of happiness i could exert myself i could do something but to be waiting so long in in action and waiting only for evil had been dreadful within the first five minutes i said i will beat bath on wednesday and i was was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to co mean d to arrive with some degree of hope you were single it was possible that you might retain the feelings of the past as i did an done encouragement happened to be mine i could never doubt that you would beloved and sought by others but i knew to a certainty that you had refused one

remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety not of risk when i yielded i thought it was to duty but no duty could be called in aid here in marrying a man indifferent to meal l risk would have been in cur red and all duty vi o late d perhaps i ought to have reason ed thus he replied but i could not i could not de r iv e benefit from the late knowledge i had acquired of your

been thinking over the pa stand trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong i mean with regard to myself and i must believe that i was right much as i suffered from it that i was perfectly

perhaps one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides and for myself i certainly never should in any circumstance of tolerable similarity gives uch advice but i meant hat i was right in submitting to her and that if i had done otherwise i should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than i did evening iv ing it up because i should have suffered in my conscience i have no was far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature nothing to reproach myself wi than d if i mistaken ota strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman s portion he looked

ever so poor or ever so imprudent or ever so little likely to be necessary to each others ult im ate comfort this may be bad morality to conclude with but i believe it to be truth and if such parties succeed how should a captain went worth and an anne elliot with the advantage of mat ur it y of mind consciousness o fright an done independent fortune between them fail of bearing down every opposition they might in fact have borne down a great deal more than they met with forth e re was little to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth sir w alter made no objection and elizabeth did nothing worse than look cold and unconcerned captain went worth with five and twenty thousand pounds and as high in his profession as merit and activity could place him was no longer nobody he wa snow esteemed quite worthy to address the daughter of a foolish spend thr if t bar one t who had not had principle or sense e nought o maintain himself in the situation in which provide

and no vanity flattered to make him really happy on the occasion was very far from thinking it a bad match for hero n the contrary when he saw more of captain went worth sa whim repeatedly by day light and eye d him well he was very much struck by his personal claims and felt t ha this superiority of appearance might be not un fairly balance d against her superiority o frank and all this assisted by hi swell sound ing name enabled sir w alter at last to prepare his pen with a very good grace forth e in se rtio no f the marriage in the volume of honour the only one among them whose opposition of feeling could excite any serious anxiety was lady r us sell anne knew that lady r us sell must be sufferings o me pain in understanding and re l in qu is h ing m re lliot and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted wi than d do justice to captain went worth this however was what lady r us sell had now to do she must learnt o feel that she had been mistaken with regard to both that she had been un fairly influenced by appearances in each that because captain went worth s manners had not suited hero wn ideas she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a character of dangerous im pet uo sit y and that because m re lliots manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correct ness their general politeness and suav it y she had been too quick in receiving them as the certain result of them o st correct opinions an dwell regulated mind there was nothing less for lady r us sell to do than to admit that she had been pretty completely wrong and to take up a news e to f opinions and of hopes there is a quickness of perception in some a nicety in the discern men to f character a natural penetration in short which no experience in others can equal and lady r us sell had been less gifted in this part of understanding than her young friend but shew as a very good woman and if her second object was to be sensible an dwell judging her first was to see anne happy she loved anne better than she loved hero wn abilities and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over found little hardship in attaching herself as a mother to them an who was securing the happiness of her other child o fall the family ma ry was probably the one most immediately gratified by the circumstance it was creditable to have a sister married and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to the connexion by keeping anne with her in the autumn and as hero wn sister must be better than her husbands sisters it was very agreeable that captain went worth should be a rich er man t ha neither captain b en wick or c ha rles hay ter she had something to suffer perhaps when they came into c on t act again in seeing anne restored to the rights of s en i or it y and the mistress of a very pretty landau let te but she had a future to look forward too f powerful consolation anne had no upper cros shall before her no landed estate no head ship of a family and if they could but keep captain went worth from being made a bar one t she would not change situations wi than ne it would be well forth e eldest sister if she were equally

sir w alter single by the watch fulness which a son in law s rights would have given but though d is com fit ed and disappointed he could still do something for his own interest and his own enjoyment he soon quitted ba than don mrs c lay s quitting it soon afterwards and being next heard of as established under his protection in london it was evident how double a game he had been playing and how determined he was to save himself from being cut out by o near tful woman at least mrs c lay s affections had overpowered her interest and she had sacrifice d forth e young man s sake the possibility of sch em ing longer for sir w alter she has abilities however a swell as affections and it i snow a doubtful point whether his cunn ing or hers may final ly carry the day whether after preventing her
