and every thing bad he could think o fb us ter did nt seem to mind h ec hu ck led a si fh e thought i tall a great joke and repeated his invitation to little jo et oco mean d ge this fish but little jo e just turned his back and went off down the laughing br ook in a great r age its too bad to waste such a fine fish said bu s ter thoughtfully i wonder what id better do with i tan d while h ewa s wondering heat ei tall up then he started down the laughing br ook to try to catch some for himself ii little jo eo t ter get seven with bu s ter bear little jo eo t ter wa sin a ter r ible r age it was a bad beginning for a beautiful d aya nd little jo e knew it but who would n tb ei n ar age if his breakfast was taken from him just a shew as about to eat i tan y way that is what little jo e told b ill y mi nk perhaps h edi dn t tell it quite exactly a sit was bu tyo u know h ewa s very badly frightened at the time iwa s sitting on the bank of the laughing br ook be side one of the little pools he told b ill y mi nk and was just going to eat a fat t rout i had caught when who should come along but that great b ig bu l lyb us ter bear he took that fat t rout away from mean date it just a si fit belonged to him i hate him i fi live long enough im going to get even with him of course that was nt nice talk and anything but a nice spirit but little jo eo t ters temper is sometimes pretty short especially when h ei s hungry and this time he had had no breakfast you know bu s ter bear had nt actually taken the fish away from little jo ebu t looking at the matter as little jo edi di t amounted to the same thing yo use ebu s ter knew perfectly well when he invited little jo e to come back and get it that little jo e would nt dared o anything of the kind where i she now asked b ill y mi nk h es somewhere up the laughing br ook i wish h ed fall in and get drowned sn ap ped little jo eb ill y mi nk just had to laugh the idea of great b ig bu s ter bear getting drowned in the laughing br ook was too fu nn y there was nt water enough in it anywhere except do w ninth e smiling po o land that wa son the green meadows where bu s ter had never been known to go lets go see what h ei s doings aid b ill y mi nka t first little jo edi dn t want to but a tl as this curiosity got the better of his fear and he agreed so the two little brown co a ted s camp s turned down the laughing br ook taking the greatest care to keep out of sight themselves they had gone only a little way when b ill y mi nk whispered sh h there h ei s sure e nought here was bu s ter bear sitting close b es idea little po o land looking into it very intently what she doing asked little jo eo t tera sb us ter bears at forth e longest time without moving just the none o fb us ters bi gp a ws went into the water as quick a sa fl as hands co ope d out at rout that h adventure d too near h es fish ing exclaimed b ill y mi nk and that is just what bu s ter bear was doing and it was very plain to see that h ewa s having great fu n when he had eaten the t rout he had caught he moved along to the next little po ol they are fish said little jo e fi erc ely he has no business catching fish i don t see how wear e going to stop him said b ill y mi n ki do cried little jo e into whose head an idea had just pop p edi m going to drive all the fish out of the little pools and mud dy the water all up then well see how many fish he will get just you watch me get even with bu s ter bear little jo e sl ipp ed swiftly into the water and sw a ms t raight to the little po ol that bu s ter bear would try next he frightened the fish so that they fl edi n every direction then he stirred up them u dun ti l the water was so dirty that bu s ter could nt have seen a fish right under his no se h edi d the same thing in the next po o land the next bu s ter bears fish ing was spoiled forth at day iii bu s ter bear is greatly puzzled bu s ter bear had nt enjoyed himself so much since he came to the green forest t olive his fu n began when he surprise d little jo eo t ter on the bank o fa little po o li n the laughing br ook and little jo ewa ss o frightened that he dropped a fat t rout he had just caught it had seemed like a great joke to bu s ter bear and he had ch u ck led over i tall the time h ewa s eating the fat t rout when he had finished i the started on to do some fish ing himself presently he came to another little po o lh es to le up to it very very softly so as not to frighten the fish then he sat down closet o the ed ge o fi tan d did nt move bu s ter learned along time ago that a fish er man must be patient unless like little jo eo t ter h ei s just as much at home in the water as the fish themselves and can sw im fast e nought o catch them b yc ha sing t hems oh edi dn t moves o much a sa n eye la sh h ewa ss o still that he looked almost like the s tu mp o fa n old tree perhaps that is what the fish thought h ewa s for pretty soon two or three sw am right in closet o where h ewa s sitting now bu s ter bear may b eb ig and clu ms y looking but there i sn t anything that can move much quicker th a none of those bi gp aw so f his when he wants i tt o one of them moved now and quicker than a wink had sc o ope done of those foolish fish out on to the bank bu s ters little eyes t wink led and h es ma cked his lips a she moved on to the next little po ol for he knew that it was o fn ou set o stay longer at the fir stone the fish were so frightened that they would nt come back for along long ti meat the next little po ol the same thing happened by this time bu s ter bear wa sin fine spirits it was fu n to catch the fi shan di t was still more fu n to eat them what fine r breakfast could any one have than fresh caught t rout no wonder he felt good but it takes more than three t rout to fill bu s ter bears stomach so he kept on to the next little po ol but this little po ol instead of being beautiful and clear so that bu s ter could see right to the bottom o fi tan d so tell if there were any fish there was so mud dy that he could nt see into i ta tall it looked a si f some one had just stirred up all them u da t the bottom hu h said bu s ter bear its o fn ou set o try to fish here i would just waste my time ill try the next pools oh e went on to the next little po o lh e found this just as mud d ya s the other then he went on to another and this was no better bu s ters at down and sc ra tc h ed his head it was puzzling y essi ri t was puzzling he looked this w aya n dh e looked that way suspiciously but there was no one to be seen every thing was still save forth e laugh ter of the laughing br ook somehow it seemed to bu s tera si f the br ook were laughing at him its very curious m uttered bu s ter very curious indeed it looks a si f my fish ing is spoiled for to day i don t understand i ta tall its lucky i caught what i did it looks a si f somebody is trying to ha a sudden thought had pop pe dint o his head then he began to ch u ck lea nd final ly to laugh i do believe that s camp jo eo t ter is trying to get even with me for eating that fat t rout and then because bu s ter bear always enjoy sa good joke even when i ti son himself he laughed un ti lh e had to hold his side s which i sa whole lot better than going off in ar age as little jo eo t ter had done your e pretty sm art mr ot ter your e pretty sm art but there are other people who are sm art too said bu s ter bear and still ch uc kl ing he went off to think u pa plan to get the best of little jo eo t ter iv little jo eo t ters u pp lies bu s ter bear with a breakfast getting even just for spite does nt always pay fact i sit is very apt to work the other way that is just ho wit ca m eabou t that little jo eo t ter furnished bu s ter bear with the best breakfast he had had for along time h edi dn t meant o do i to h my not he truth i she thought all the time that h ewa s preventing bu s ter bear from getting a breakfast you see h ewa sn t well enough acquainted with bu s ter to know that bu s ter is quite a ss m art a she is and perhaps a little b its ma r ter spite and selfishness were at the bottom o fit you see little jo e and b ill y mi nk had had all the fish ing in the laughing br ook to themselves so long that they thought no one else had any right to fish there to be sure bo bb yc oo n caught a few little fish there but they did nt mind bo bb y farmer brown s boy fish ed there too sometimes and this always made little jo e and b ill y mi nk very angry but they were so afraid of him that they did nt dared o anything about it but when they discovered that bu s ter bear was a fish er man they made up their minds that something had got to be done at least little jo edi dh e ll try it again to morrow mornings aid little jo e ill keep watch and as soon a si see him coming ill drive ou tall the fish just a si did to day i guess that ll teach him to le tour fish alone so the next morning little jo e hid before day light close by the little po ol where bu s ter bear had given him such af rights u re enough just as the jo ll y sun beam s began to creep through the green forest he saw bu s ter bear coming st raight over to the little po ol little jo e sl ipp e dint o the water and c has ed all the fish out of the little po o land stirred up them u don the bottom so that the water was so mud dy that the bottom could n tb e seen a tall then he hurried down to the next little po o land did the same thing now bu s ter bear is very s ma r tyo u know he had guessed the day before who had spoiled his fish ing so this morning he only went fare nought o makes u re that if little jo e were watching for him a shew assure he would b eh e would see him coming then instead of keeping on to the little po o lh e hurried to a place way down the laughing br ook where the water was very sh allow hardly over his feet and there he sat ch uc kl ing to himself things happened just a she had expected the frightened fish little jo ec has ed out of the little pools up above sw am down the laughing br ook because you know little jo ewa s behind them and there was nowhere else forth em to go when they came to the place where bu s ter was waiting all he had to do was to sc oo p them out on to the bank it was great fu n it did nt take bu s ter long to catch all the fish he could eat then he saved a nice fat t rout and waited by and by along came little jo eo t ter ch uc kl ing to think how he had spoiled bu s ter bears fish ing h ewa ss o intent on looking behind him to see i fb us ter was coming that h edi dn ts e ebu s ter waiting there un ti lh e spoke im much obliged forth e fine breakfast you have given me said bu s ter in his deepest most gr u mbl yru mbl y voice i ve saved a fat t rout for y out o make up forth e one i ate yesterday i hope well go fish ing together often then he went off laughing fit to k ill himself little jo e could nt find a word to say h ewa ss o surprise d and angry that he went off by himself and su lk ed and b ill y mi nk who had been watching ate the fat t rout v grand father fro gs common sense there is nothing quite like common sense to smooth out troubles people who have plenty of just plain common sense are often thought to b every wise their n ei ghb o rs look up to them an dare forever running to them for advice and they ar every much respected that is th ewa y with grand father fro gh ei s very old and very wise any way that is what his n ei ghb o rs think the truth i she simply has a lot of common sense which after al list h every best kind o fwi sd om now when little jo eo t ter found that bu s ter bear had been too sm art for hi man d that instead of spoil ing bu s ters fish ing in the laughing br ook he had really made it easier for bu s ter to catch all the fish he wanted little jo e went off down to the smiling po o li na great r age b ill y mi nk stopped long e nought o eat the fat fish bu s ter had left on the bank and then he too went down to the smiling po ol when little jo eo t tera n db ill y mi nk reached the smiling po ol they c limb ed upon the b ig rock and there little jo e su lk ed and su lk e dun ti l final ly grand father fro g asked what the matter was little jo e would nt tell but b ill y mi nk told the whole story when he told how bu s ter had been too sm art for little jo ei tt ick led him so that b ill y had to laugh in spite of himself so did grand father fro gs o did je rry mu sk ra t who had been listening of course this made little jo ea ng rier th a never he said a lot of unkind things about bu s ter bear and about b ill y mi nk and grand father fro g and je rry mu sk ra t because they had laughed at the sm art ness o fb us ter h es nothing but a great b ig bu ll y and th i ef declared little jo ec hu gar

can you tell met he difference between the fish that you have nt caught and the foolish green flies that i have nt caught asked grand father fro g little jo e could nt find a word to say you take my

those wh olive i nor along the laughing br ook o ri n the smiling po ol they let little jo e have his own w ayi n every thing now having ones own way too much i sa bad thing i tis apt to make one selfish and thoughtless of other people and very hard to get along with little jo eo t ter had his way too much grand father fro g knew i tan d shook his he adver y sober ly when little jo e had been

though h edi dn t let on that it was so grand father fro g really was delighted when he heard how bu s ter bear had been too sm art for little jo eo t ter i tt ick led him so that he had hard work to

was good common sense advice but little jo e just sn if fed and went off declaring that he would get even with bu s ter bear yet now little jo ei s goodnatured and full off un a sa rule and after he had reached ho mean d his temper had cooled off a little he began to see the joke on himself how when he had worked so hard to frighten the fish in the little pools of the laughing br ook so that bu s ter bear should not catch any he had all the time been driving them right into bu s ters pa w sb y and b yh e gr inn edi t was a little sheep i sh gr in at first but at last it grew into a laugh i believes aid little jo ea shew i ped tears of laugh ter from his eyes that grand father fro gi s right and that the best thing i can do is to make friends with bu s ter bear ill try i tt o morrow mornings o very early the next morning little jo eo t ter went to the best fish ing po o lh e knew o fi n the laughing br ook and there he caught the bi gg es tt rout he could find it was so b ig and fat that it made little jo es mouth water for you know fat t rout are his fa vo ri te food but h edi dn t takes o much as one bit e instead he carefully laid i to n an old lo g where bu s ter bear would be sure to see i ti fh e should come along that way then he hid near by where he could watch bu s ter was late that morning it seemed to little jo e that he never would come once he nearly lost the fish he had turned his head for just a minute and when he looked back again the t rout was nowhere to be seen bu s ter could nt have stolen up and taken it because such ab ig fellow could nt possibly have got ten out of sight again little jo e darted over to the lo g and looked on the others i de there was the fat t rout and there also was little jo es smallest cousins had ow the w ease l who i sa great th i ef and altogether bad little jo e sp ran ga th i man g rily but shadow was too quick and darted away little jo e put the fish back on the lo g and waited this time h edi dn t take his eyes of fit at last when h ewa s almost ready to give u ph e saw bu s ter bears huf fling along towards the laughing br ook suddenly bu s ter stopped and sn if fe done of the merry little b re eze s had carried the sc en to f that fat t rout over to him then he came st raight over to where the fish lay his no se w ri n kl ing and his eyes twinkling with pleasure now i wonder w how a ss o

he always whist les when he feel slight hearted and he always feel slight hearted when he goes fish ing you see h ei s just as fond of fish ing a si s little jo eo t ter o rb ill y mi n ko rb us ter

he knew every po o li n the laughing br ook where the t rout love to hid edi d farmer brown s boy and it was just the kind o fa morning when the t rout should be hungry so he whist led a she tr am ped along and his whist l ewa s good to hear when he reached the first little po o lh eb ai ted hi shook very carefully and then taking the greatest care to keep out of sight of any t rout that might b ei n the little po o lh e began to fish now farmer brown s boy learned along time ago that to b ea successful fish er ma none must have a great deal of patience so though h edi dn t get a bit e right

ib b le either the t rout have lost their appetite or they have grown very wise m uttered farmer brown s boy as after along time he moved on to the next little po ol there the same thing happened h ewa s very patient very very patient bu this patience brought no reward not so much as the faint e st kind o fa n ib b le farmer brown s boy tru d ge don to the next po o land there was a puzzled frown on his fr ec k led faces uch a thing never had happened before h edi dn t know what to make o fi tall the night before he had dream ed about the delicious dinner of fried t rout he would have the next d aya nd now well i fh edi dn t catch some t rout pretty soon that s ple n did dinner would never be anything but a dream i fi did nt know that nobody else comes fish ing here i should think that somebody had been here this very morning and caught all the fish or else frightened t hems o that they a real li n hid ing said h ea she tru d ge don to the next little po o li never had such bad

fish ing here and they have had better luck than i have thought h eh e looked up the laughing br ook and down the laughing br ook and this w aya nd that way but n oo new as to be seen then he pick ed upon eo f the little head s and looked a ti t sharp ly it was nt cut off with a knife it was bit ten off he exclaimed i wonder now i fb ill y mi n ki s the s camp who has spoiled my fu nt hereafter he kept a sharp look out for sign so fb ill y mi nk but though he found two or three more t rout head she saw no others i gn s and he caught no fish this puzzled him more th a never it did nt seem possible that such a little fellow a sb ill y mi nk could have caught or frightened all the fish or have eaten so many besides h edi dn t remember ever having known b ill y to leave head s around that way b ill y sometimes catch es more fish than h ec a neat but then he usually hid es them the farther he went down the laughing br ook the more puzzled farmer brown s boy grew it made him feel very queer he would have felt still more queer i fh e had known th a tall the time two other fish er men who had been before him were watching hi man dc hu c kl ing to themselves they were little jo eo t tera n db us ter bear viii farmer brown s boy feels his hair rise t was just a sudden odd surprise made farmer brown s boys hair to rise that s afun ny thing for hair to do rise up all o fa sudden i sn ti t but that is just what the ha iron farmer brown s boys head did the day he went fish ing in the laughing br ook and had no luck a tall there are just two things that make hair rise anger and fear anger sometimes makes the ha iron the back and neck of bows er the h ound and of some other little people b ri st lea nd stand up and you know the ha iron the t ail of black pu s sy stands on end un ti l her t ail looks twice a sb i ga sit really is both anger and fear m akei td o that but there is only one thing that can make the ha iron the head of farmer brown s boy rise and a sit i sn t anger of course it must be fear it never had happened before you see there i sn t much of anything that farmer brown s boy is really afraid of perhaps he would nt have been afraid this time i fit had nt been forth e surprise of what he found you see when he had found the head so f those t rout on the bank he kne wright away that some one else had been fish ing and that was why he could nt catch any but it did nt seem possible that little b ill y mi nk could have eaten all those t rout and farmer brown s boy did nt once think of little jo eo t tera nd so h ewa s very very much puzzled h ewa s turning i ta l lover in his mind and study ing what it could mean when he came to a little mud dy place on the bank of the laughing br ook and there he saw something that made his eyes look a si f they would pop right out of his head and it was right then that he fel this hair rise any way that is what he said when he told about it after w ard what wa sit he saw what do you think why it was a

farmer brown s boy feel fear as they had felt i tan d so it was that bu s ter bear became a hero right away to most of them a few doubted little jo es story one of them was black y the c row another was red dy fo x black y doubted because he knew farmer brown s boys o well that he could nt imagine him afraid red dy doubted because h edi dn t want to believe you see h ewa s jealous o fb us ter

could he ever be made to believe it but nearly every body else believed i tan d there was great rejoicing most of them were afraid o fb us ter very much afraid of him because h ewa ss ob ig and strong but they were still more afraid of farmer brown s boy because they did n tk no whim or understand hi man d because in the past he had tried to catch some of them in tr a ps and had hunt ed some of

so many ways to sho whim how friendly they felt and went quite out of their way to do him fa vo rs whenever they me tone another all they could talk about was the sm art ness and the greatness o fb us

of the green forest nearest to farmer brown s house and never fo ran instant had he taken his eyes from farmer brown s back door what wa she watching for why for farmer brown s boy to come out on his way to milk the cows meanwhile sa mm yj ay was sl ipp ing silently through the green forest looking for bu s ter bears o that when the time came he could le this cousin black y the c row know just where bu s ter was by and by the back door of farmer brown s house opened and outstepped farmer brown s boy in each hand he carried a milk p ail right away black y began to scream at the top of his

fit you sees m art a she is and shr ew da she is black y does nt know anything about the meaning of duty for he never has to work excepting to get e nought o eats o when farmer brown s boy started forth e bar n instead of forth e green forest black y did nt know what to make o fit he scream ed hard e ran d louder th a never un ti l his voice grew so hoarse he could nt scream any more but farmer brown s boy kept right on to the bar n id like to know what your e making such a fuss about mr c row but i ve got to feed the cows and milk them first said h en o wall this time the other little people of the green forest and the green meadows had been hid ing where they could see all that went on when farmer brown s boy di s appeared in the bar n chatter er there d squi rr els n ick e red right out loud ha ha ha this i sa great plan of yours black yh a ha ha he sho u ted black y could nt find a word to say he just hung his head which is something black y seldom does perhaps if we wait un ti lh e comes out again he will come over here s aids a mm yj ay who had joined black y so it was decided to wait it seemed a si f farmer brown s boy never would come out but at last h edi d black y and sa mm yj aya t once began to scream and make all the fuss they could farmer brown s boy took the two pa ils of milk into the house then out h ec a mean d started st raight forth e green forest h ewa ss o curious to know what i tall meant that he could nt wait another minute now there was some one else with a great deal of curiosity also he had heard the scream ing of black y the c row and sa mm yj aya n dh e had listened un ti lh e could nt stand it another minute he just to know what it was all about so at the same time farmer brown s boy started forth e green forest this other listeners tart ed towards the place where black y and sa mm y were making such a rack eth e walked very softly so as not to make a sound it was bu s ter bear xiii farmer brown s boy and bu s ter bear meet if you should meet with bu s ter bear while walking through the wood what would you do now tell me truer un the best i could that is what farmer brown s boy did when he met bu s ter bear and a lot of the little people of the green forest and some from the green meadows sa whim when farmer brown s boy came hurrying home from the laughing br ook without any fish one d aya nd told about the great foot pri n the had seen in a mud dy place on the bank deep in the green forest and had said his w assure that it was the foot pr into fa bear he had been laughed at farmer brown had laughed and laughed why said he there has nt been a bear in the green forest for years and years and years not since my own grand father was a little boy and that you know was along long long time ago if you want to find mr bear you will have to got o the great woods i don t know whom a de that foot pri nt but it certainly could nt have been a bear i think you must have imagined it then he had laughed some more all of which goes to show how easy i tis to be mistaken and how foolish i tis to laugh at things you really don t know about bu s ter bear come t olive in the green forest and farmer brown s boy seen his foot pri nt but farmer brown laughed so much and made fu n of him so much that a tl as this boy began to think that he must have been mistaken after all so when he heard black y the c row and sa mm yj ay making a great fuss n earth ee d ge of the green forest he never once thought o fb us ter bear a she started over to see what was going on when black y and sa mm y sa whim coming they moved a little farther into the green forest still scream ing in them o st excited way they felt sure that farmer brown s boy would follow them and they meant to lead him to wheres a mm y had seen bu s ter b earth at morning then they would find out for sure if what little jo eo t ter had said was true that farmer brown s boy really was afraid o fb us ter b earn o wall around behind trees and s tu mp s and under thick branch es and even in tree top s were other little people watching with round wi de open eyes to see what would happen it was very exciting them o st exciting thing they could remember you see they had come to believe that farmer brown s boy was nt afraid of any body or anything and as most of them w er every much afraid of him they had hard work to believe that he would really be afraid of even such a great b ig strong fellow a sb us ter bear every o new a ss o busy watching farmer brown s boy that no ones a wb us ter coming from the other direction yo use ebu s ter walked

they stood there face to face gaz ing into each others eyes while every body watched and waited and it seemed a si f the whole green forest was holding its breath then something happened y essi r something happened farmer brown s boy opened his mouth and ye ll edi t was such a sudden ye l lands uch aloud ye ll that it startled chatter ers o that he nearly fell from his place in the tree and it

brown s boy run away they looked on bu s ter bear with a great deal of respect and w er every proud of him but now they had seen bu s ter bear and farmer brown s boy meet face to face and while it was true that farmer brown s boy had run away as fast as ever he could it was also true that bu s ter bear had done the same thing he had run even faster than farmer brown s boy and had hid de ninth e most lonely place he could fi n dint h every deepest part of the green forest it was hard to believe but it was true and right away every body lost a great deal of the respect for bu s ter which they had felt i tis always that way they began to say unkind things about him they said them among themselves and some of them even said them to bu s ter when they met him or said t hems o that he would h earth e mo f course black y the c row and sa mm yj ay who because they can fly have nothing to fear from bu s tera nd who always delight in making other people uncomfortable never let a chance go by to tell bu s tera nd every body else within hearing what they thought of him they delighted in flying about through the green forest un ti l they had found bu s ter bear and then from the safety of the tree top s scream ing at him bu s ter bear i sb ig and strong his tee th are b ig his c law sar e long in spite of these he runs away and hid es himself the live long d aya dozen times a day bu s

little chatter er there d squi rr els h out edt he same thing from a place ju stout of reach in a bi gp in e tree bu s ter could stand i tn o longer he gave a deep angry grow l that made little shi

c limb but bu s ter i sa s ple n did c limb er especially when the tree i sb ig and stout as this o new as and now he went up after chatter er grow li n gang rily how chatter er did wish that he had k ep this tongues till he ran to th every top of the trees o frightened th a this tee th chatter ed and when he looked down and saw bu s ters great mouth coming nearer and nearer he nearly tu mb led down with terror the worst o fit was there was nt another tree near enough for him to jump to h ewa sin trouble this time was chatter er sure enough and there was no one to help him xvi chatter er there d squi rr el jump s for his life i tis nt very often that chatter er there d squi rr el knows f earth a tis one reason that h ei ss o often impudent and saucy but once in a while a great fear takes possession of him as when he knows that shadow the w ease li s looking for him you see he knows that shadow can go wherever he can go there ar every few of the little people of the green forest and the green meadows who do not know fear at some time or other but it comes to chatter er as seldom as to any one because h ei s very sure of himself and his ab ili ty to hid eo r run away from danger but now a she clung to a little branch n earth e top o fatal lp in e tree in the green forest and looked down at the b ig sharp tee th o fb us ter bear drawing nearer and nearer and listened to the deep angry grow ls that made his hair stand on end chatter er was too frightened to think if only he had k ep this tongues till instead of saying hateful things to bu s ter bear if only he had known that bu s ter could c limb a tree if only he had chosen a tree near e nought o other trees for him to jump across bu the said hateful things he chosen to sit in a tree which stood quite by itself and bu s ter bear c limb chatter er wa sin the worst kind of trouble and there was no one to blame but himself that is usually the case with those who get into trouble nearer and nearer came bu s ter bear and deeper and an g rier sounded his voice chatter er gave a little frightened ga spa nd looked this w aya nd looked that way what should h ed o what he doth e grounds ee me date rr ible

f the little branch to which he had been clinging now if chatter er had only known i tb us ter bear could nt reach him way up there because the tree was too small at the top for such ab ig fellow a sb us ter but chatter er did nt think of that he gave one more frightened look down at those b ig tee th then he sh u this eyes and jumped jumped st raight out forth e far away ground it was along long long way down to the ground and it certainly looked a si f such a little fellow as chatter er must be killed but chatter er had learned from old mother nature that she had given him certain things to help hi mat just such times an done of them is the power to spread himself very fl a th edi di t now he spread his arms and leg s out just as far a she could and that kept him from falling as fa stand as hard a she otherwise would have done because being spread out so fl at that way the air held him u pa little and then there was his t ail that fu nn y little t ail h ei ss o fond o fj er king when he scold s this helped him too it helped him keep his balance and keep from turning over and over down down down he sail ed and landed on his feet of course he hit the ground pretty hard and for just a second he quite los this breath but it was only for a second and then h ewa ss cu rry ing off as fast a sa frightened squi rr el could bu s ter bear watched hi man d gr inn edi did nt catch him that time he grow led but i guess i gave him a good fright and taught him a lesson xvii bu s ter bear goes be rry ing bu s ter bear i sa great hand total k to himself when he thinks no one is around to overhear its a habit however i tis n ta bad habit unless i tis carried too far any habit becomes bad i fit is carried too far suppose you had a secret a real secret something that nobody else knew and that you did nt want any body else to know and suppose you had the habit of talking to yourself you might without thinking you know tell that secret out loud to yourself and some one might just might happen to overhear then there would n tb e any secret that is th ewa y that a habit which i sn t bad in itself can become bad when i tis carried too far now bu s ter bear had lived by himself in the great woods so long that this habit of talking to himself had grown and grown h edi di t just to keep from being l ones o me of course when he came down to the green forest t olive he brought all his habits with him that is one thing about habits you always take them with you wherever you go so bu s ter brought this habit of talking to himself down to the green forest where he had many more n ei ghb o rs than h eh a dint he great woods let me see let me see what is there to tempt my appetite said bu s ter in his deep gr u mbl yru mbl y voice i find my appetite i sn t what it ought to b ei

ei d go up there bu s ter sighed then he sighed again the more he thought about those b er r ies he felt sure were growing in the old past ur eth e more he wanted some it seemed to him that never in all his life had he wanted b er ri e sashed id now he wander ed about un easily h ewa s hungry hungry for b er r ies and nothing else by and b yh e began talking to himself again if iwa sn t afraid of

there a tt h every first p ee po f day to morrow i can ea tall i want and get back to the green forest before there is any danger that farmer brown s boy o ran y one else im afraid of will seem e that

us ter does nt change his minds a mm yw a son the look out very early the next morning the first jo ll y little sun beam s had only reached the green meadows and had not started to creep into the

will often think of the same thing at the same ti mean d neither one know that the other is thinking o fit that is just what happened the day that bu s ter bear first thought of going be rry ing while h ewa s walking around in the green forest talking to himself about how hungry h ewa s for some b er r ies and how sure h ewa s that there must be some u pi n the old pastures o me one else was thinking about b er r ies and about the old past u re too will you make me a be rry pi ei fi will get the b er r ies to morrow asked farmer brown s boy of his mother of course mrs brown promised that she would and so that night farmer brown s boy went to bed very early that he might get up early in the morning and all night long he dream ed o fb er r ies and be rry pies h ewa s awake even before jo ll y round red mr sun thought it was time to get up and h ewa s all ready to start forth e old past u re when the first jo ll y little sun beam s came dancing across the green meadows he carried ab

foot of the b ig mount a in and even extend sa little way upon the b ig mount a in there is room in it for many people topic j er r ies all day without even seeing each other unless they ro am about a great deal you see th ebu she s grow very thick there and you cannot se every far in any direction jo ll y round red mr sun had c limb ed a little way u pi n the sky by the time farmer brown s boy reached the old past u re and was smiling down on all the great world and all the great world seemed to be smiling back farmer brown s boy started to whist lea nd then he stopped i fi whist le thought he every body will know just where ia man d will keep out of sight and i never can get acquainted with folk si f they keep out of sight you see farmer brown s boy was just beginning to understands o me thing that pe ter r abb i tan d the other little people of the green meadows and the green forest learned almost as soon as they learned to walk that if you don t want to be seen you must n tb e heard so h edi dn t whist lea she felt like doing and he tried not to make a bit of noise a she followed an old cow path towards a place where he knew the b er r ies grew thick and oh so b ig and all the time h ek ep this eyes wi de open and h ek ep this e ars open tooth a ti show he happened to hear a little c rya very faint little c ryi fh e had been whist l ing he would nt have heard i ta tall he stopped to listen he never had heard a cry just like it before at first he could nt make out just what it was or where it came from bu tone thing h ew assure of and that was that it was a cry of fright he stood perfectly still and listened wit hall his might there it was again help help help and it was very faint and sounded terribly frightened he waited a minute or two but heard nothing more then he put down hi spa i land began a hurried look here there and everywhere h ew assure that it had come from somewhere on the grounds oh ep ee red behind bu she s and peeped behind lo gs and stone s and then just a she had about given up hope of finding where it came from he went around a little tu r ninth e old cow pa than d there right in front of him was little mr garters n ake and what do you think h ewa s doing well i don t like to tell you but h ewa s trying to sw allow one of the children o fs t ick y to es the tree t oad of course farmer brown s boy did nt let him he made little mr garters n akes et masters t ick y to es free and held mr garters n ake un ti l masters t ick y to es was safely out of reach xix bu s ter bear has a fine time bu s ter bear was having the finest time he had had since he came down from the great woods t olive in the green forest to be sure h ewa sn ti n the green forest now but h ewa sn t far from i th ewa sin the old past ur eo need ge of which touches o need ge of the green forest and where do you think h ewa sin the old past u re why right in the middle of the bi gg e st patch of the bi gg e st blue b er r ies he ever had seen in all his life now if there is any one thing that bu s ter bear had rather have above another i tis all the b er r ies h ec a neat unless i tb eh one y nothing can quite equal h one yi n bu s ters mind but next to h one y give him b er r ies h ei sn t particular what kind o fb er r ies ra sp b er r ies black b er r ies or blue b er r ies either kind will make him perfectly happy umm mm y my but these are

now and then he got leaves and some green b er ri e sin his mouth with the b ig rip eb er r ies h edi dn t try to get them out oh my n oh e just c hom ped them all up together and pa t ted his stomach from she er delight now bu s ter had reached the old past u re just a sjo ll y round red mr sun had cr ep t out of bed and he had fully made up his mind that he would be back in the green forest before mr sun had c limb ed very far u pi n the blue blue sky you see bi ga she is and strong a she i sb us ter bear is very shy and ba sh fu land he has no desire to meet farmer brown or farmer brown s boy o ran y other of those two leg ge d creatures called men it seems fu nn yb u the actually is afraid of them and he had a feeling that h ewa sa great deal more likely to meet one of them in the old past u re than deep in the green forest so when he started to look for b er r ies he made up his mind that he would eat what he could in a great hurry and get back to the green forest before farmer brown s boy was more than out of bed but when he found those b er ri e shew a ss o hungry that he forgot his fears and every thing else they taste d so good that he just had to ea tan d ea tan

ed from one patch o fb er r ies to another in the old past u re and never once thought of the time somehow time is the hard e st thing in the world to remember when you are having a good time jo ll y round red mr sun c limb ed higher and higher in the blue blue sky he looked down on all the great world and sa wall that was going on he saw bu s ter bear in the old past u re and smiled a she saw what a perfectly glorious time bu s ter was having and he saw something else in the old past u re that made his smiles till broader he saw farmer brown s boy filling a great ti np ail with blue b er r ies and he knew that farmer brown s boy did nt know that bu s ter bear was anywhere about and he knew that bu s ter bear did nt know that farmer brown s boy was anywhere about and somehow he felt very sure that he would see something fu nn y happen if they should chance to meet umm m umm m mum b led bu s ter bear with his mouth full a she moved along to another patch o fb er r ies and then he gave a little ga spo f surprise and delight right in front of him wa sash in y thing just full of the finest bi gg e st blue s tb er r ies there were no leaves or green ones there bu s ter b li nk ed his gr ee dy little eyes rapidly and looked again n oh ewa sn t dreaming they were real b er r ies and all he had got to do was to help himself bu s ter looked sharp ly a tt h eshi ny thing that held the b er ri e sit seemed perfectly harmless he reached out a bi gp a wan d pushed it gently i tt ipp ed over and sp il led out a lot of the b er r ies ye sit was perfectly harmless bu s ter gave a little sigh of pure happiness he would eat those b er r ies to the la stone and then he would go home to the green forest k bu s ter bear carries off the p ail of farmer brown s boy the question is did bu s ter bears tea l farmer brown s boys p ail to s tea list o take something which belongs to some one else there i sn o doubt that h es to let h eb er r ies that were in the p ail when he found it for he deliberately ate them he knew well e nought hat some one must have pick ed them for whoever heard of blue b er r ies growing in ti n pa ils so there i sn o doubt that when bu s ter took them h es to

br imm ing full of delicious b er ri e sin the shade of that b ig bu s hint he old past ur eh edi dn t stopt o think whether or not he had aright to them bu s ter i ss o fond o fb er r ies that from th every second th a this gr ee dy little eyes saw that p ail ful he forgot every thing but the f east that was waiting for him right under his very no se h edi dn t think anything about the right or

edi d do of course h eu p set the p ail but h edi dn t mind a little thing like that when he had go bb led up all the b er r ies th a troll ed out h et hru s this no se into the p ail to ge tall that were left in it just then he heard a little noise a si f some one were coming he threw up his head to listen and some ho whenever did know just how the handle of the pa ils l ipp ed back over his e

wa sit was the voice of farmer brown s boy right then and there bu s ter bear nearly had a fit there was that awful p ail fast over his head so that he could nt see a thing of course that meant that he could n tru n away which was the thing o fall things he most wanted to do for bi ga she is and strong a she i sb us ter is very shy and ba sh ful when human beings are around he grow led and whi n

us ter had nt been so frightened himself he might have re cogni ze d that second ye l la s one of fright forth a tis what it was you see farmer brown s boy had just discovered bu s ter bear when he had ye ll edt he first time he had supposed that it was one of the young cattle wh olive in the old past u real l summer but when he saw bu s ter h ewa s just as badly frightened a sb us ter himself in fact h ewa s too surprise d and frightened event o run after that second ye ll he just stood still and stared bu s ter c law ed at that awful thing on his head more f ran ti call y th a never suddenly its l ipp ed off so that he could see he gave one frightened look at farmer brown s boy and then with a mighty wo o fh e started forth e green forest as fast as his leg s could take hi man d this was very fast indeed let me tell you h edi dn t stop topic k out a path but just c ra she d through th ebu she sa si f they were nothing a tall just nothing a tall but the fu nn ies t thing o

out o smiles the best thing you can do to smile and say im mighty glad they are no worse they re not so bad that is what farmer brown s boy said when he found that bu s ter bear had stolen the b er r

and right a ways ee how they are better than they might have been when he had first heard some one in th ebu she s where he had hid d en hi spa i lo fb er r ies he had been very sure that it was one of the cows or young cattle wh olive in the old past u re during the summer he had been afraid that they might stupid ly kic k over the pa i lands p ill the b er r ies and he had hurried to drive whoever it was away it had nt entered his head that it could be any body who would eat those b er r ies when he had ye l led and bu s ter bear had suddenly appeared st ruggl ing to get off the p ail which had caught over his head farmer brown s boy had been too frightened to even move then he had seen bu s ter tear away through the b rush even more frightened than h ewa s and right away his courage had begun to come back i fh ei ss o afraid of me i guess i need n tb e afraid of him said h ei ve lost my b er r ies but i tis worth i tt o find out that h ei s afraid of me there are plenty more on th ebu she s and al live got to do is topic k them it might be worse he walked over to the place where the p ail had been and then he remembered that when bu s ter ran away he had carried the p ail with him hanging about his neck he whist l edi t was ac omi ca l little whist le o fc ha gr in as here a lized that he had nothing in which to put more b er ri e seven i fh e pick ed them its worse than i thought cried he that bear has c heated me out of that be rry pi e my mother promised me then he began to laugh a she thought of how fu nn yb us ter bear had looked with the p ail about his neck and then because you know h ei s learn ing to b ea ph i los op her he once more repeated it might have been worse yes indeed it might have been worse that bear might have tried to eat me instead of the b er r ies i guess ill go eat that lu n ch i left back by the spring and then ill go home i can pick b er r ies some other day ch uc kl ing happily over bu s ter bears great fright farmer brown s boy tr am ped back to the spring where he had left two thick sandwiches on a fl at stone when he started to save hi spa i lo fb er r ies my but those sandwiches will taste good thought h ei m glad they are b ig and thick i never was hung rier in my life h el lo this he exclaimed right out loud for he had just come insight of the fl at stone where the sandwiches should have been and they were not there no sir there was n ts o much a sa c rumble f to f those two thick sandwiches you see old man co yo te had found them and go bb led them up while farmer brown s boy was away but farmer brown s boy did nt know anything about old man co yo te he rub bed his eyes and stared everywhere even u pi n the trees a si fh e thought those sandwiches might be hanging up there they had di

growing angry a slow smiles to le over his fr ec k led face i guess some one else was hungry too h em uttered wonder who it was guess this old past ur ei sn o place form e to day ill fill upon b er r

old past u re two or three times a she tru d ge d along he stopped to sc ra tc h his head thoughtfully i guess said heat last that im not so sm art a si thought iwa s and i ve got a lot to learn yet this is the end of the adventure so fb us ter bear in this book because guess why because old mr to adi n si s ts that i must write a book about his adventure s and old mr to adi s such a good friend
